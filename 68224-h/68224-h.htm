</div>

<p>This survey deals with the several commercially important types of
synthetic resins covered by paragraphs 2, 11, and 28 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 and with the raw materials necessary for their production.
It is made under the general investigatory powers of the Tariff
Commission as provided in section 332 of that act.</p>

<p>The field of synthetic resins is a comparatively new one, most
of its commercial development having occurred within the past 10
years. In 1937 the domestic output was more than 160 million
pounds as compared with slightly more than 10 million pounds in
1927.</p>

<p>The first important patents on synthetic resins were granted about
25 years ago. These patents covered phenolic resins probably intended
for use as substitutes for certain natural resins. It was soon
found that these synthetics offered possibilities of application vastly
greater than the natural materials. At first progress in their application
was slow as is usually the case with new products. During
the World War the shortage of phenol promoted interest in the
use of the other tar acids as raw materials for synthetic resins and
intensive research developed resins from the cresols and higher boiling
tar acids. These resins possessed properties sufficiently different
from those made from phenol to establish them permanently.</p>

<p>In the meantime research on other types of resins was carried on
in the United States and in Europe. The tar-acid resins for molding
were the only commercially important ones on the market until
about 1929. About that time, however, new commercial products began
to appear rapidly. Cast phenolic resins became available as
material for novelties of unusual brilliancy and beauty, the urea
resins to meet the requirements for light colored thermosetting resins
in molded articles, and the alkyd resins for use in new surface coatings
which replaced conventional paint materials.</p>

<p>Later there followed a number of thermoplastic materials offering
new and unusual properties. Vinyl resins found application in
molded products and in safety glass. The acrylate resins became the
nearest approach to organic glass yet developed. The polystyrene
resins, long in the research stage, made their commercial appearance
in 1937. Resins from petroleum, from furfural, from adipic acid,
and from aniline are on the market. Many others are under investigation
and some of them will undoubtedly become important.</p>

<p>The versatility of synthetic resins is most unusual. In various
uses they have successfully displaced glass, wood, metal, hard rubber,
bone, glue, cellulose plastics, protein plastics, and conventional paint
materials. They compete with glass in shades and reflectors and
offer properties which will increase their use for this purpose. Cases
for scales, radios, and clocks, formerly of wood and metal, are now
made of these synthetic resins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading1-1">Scope and purpose.</h3>

<p>This survey deals with the synthetic resins, the nature and trade
in the raw materials necessary for their production, the processes by
which they are made, trade in them in the United States and between
nations, and the nature of the competition which they meet. It does
not go into the details of manufacture of and trade in the multitude
of articles made of synthetic resins but stops at the point where these
materials are turned over to the resin fabricator. The synthetic
resins are but one of four broad groups of organic plastics. The
others—natural resins, cellulose ethers and esters, and protein plastics—are
discussed herein only as they relate to or compete with
the synthetic resins.</p>

<p>The purpose of the survey is to bring together in one publication
the available information on synthetic resins so as to provide a basis
for consideration of future tariff problems. Because the industries
involved are comparatively young and are expanding rapidly, their
present day importance is not generally realized. The rapidity with
which the synthetic resin industry is developing causes any comprehensive
report on the subject to be practically out of date before it
can be published. Notwithstanding the progress made each year in
the quantity of production, new applications, and new commercial
products, the industry may be said to be still in the industrial nursery.
This circumstance necessarily limits the period during which any
treatment of the subject will be representative.</p>

<h3 id="heading1-2">Fundamental definitions.</h3>

<p>The scope of this report has been stated to include synthetic resins
up to the point where they are further manufactured, and the raw
materials used in producing them. It was also stated that natural
resins and synthetic plastics other than resins, such as the cellulose
compounds and modified rubber compounds, are excluded. The
boundaries of these categories are therefore important.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The term “resin” was formerly applied exclusively to a group of
natural products, principally of vegetable origin, although at least
one important resin, shellac, is of animal origin.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> These natural
resins are widely used in paints, varnishes, and lacquers for decorative
and protective surface coatings. They also have extensive use in
textile impregnation, adhesives, soap, paper, and in cold-molded
articles. In recent years the natural resins have had to compete with
synthetic products, and each gravitates toward uses which demand the
quality or combination of qualities which it can most completely
supply.</p>

<p>A resin may be defined as a semisolid or solid, complex, amorphous
mixture of organic compounds with no definite melting point and
no tendency to crystallize. The resins are characterized by a typical
luster and a conchoidal fracture rather than by definite chemical
composition. The term includes natural resins, such as colophony
(ordinary rosin), copal, damar, lac, mastic, sandarac, shellac, etc.,
sometimes called gums or gum resins although none of them are
true gums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>A synthetic resin is a resin made by synthesis from nonresinous
organic compounds. The term includes materials ranging from
viscous liquids to hard, infusible, amorphous solids. As a rule synthetic
resins possess properties distinct from those of natural resins.
The term “plastics,” sometimes applied to synthetic resins, also
includes many materials which are not resins.</p>

<p>A plastic is anything possessing plasticity; that is, anything which
can be deformed under mechanical stress without losing its coherence
or its ability to keep its new form. According to this
definition the term includes such materials as putty, cement, clay,
glass, and metals, as well as certain modified natural or semisynthetic
products, such as cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, and casein more
commonly so designated. To speak of the plastics industries is almost
meaningless because of their enormous scope, including as they do
those producing cement, ceramics, confectionery and rubber, as well
as those producing the semisynthetic products mentioned.</p>

<p>The resin industry embraces two main types of materials, thermoplastic
and thermosetting. Thermoplastic materials are those which,
although rigid at normal temperatures, may be deformed and
molded under heat and pressure. Among such materials are the
cellulose esters, acrylate resins, vinyl resins, polystyrene resins, etc.
The recent development of injection molding has given thermoplastics
a new significance.</p>

<p>Thermosetting substances are thermoplastic at some stage of their
existence, but become hard, rigid, and permanently infusible upon
the application of the proper heat and pressure. They are then
irreversible whereas the thermoplastics are reversible. Outstanding
among the thermosetting resins are tar-acid resins, urea resins, and
the alkyd resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading1-3">Tariff history.</h3>

<p>The earliest mention of synthetic resins in the tariff laws of the
United States was the provision in group III of the Emergency
Tariff Act of 1916 for a duty of 30 percent ad valorem and 5 cents
per pound on synthetic phenolic resins. None of the non-coal-tar
synthetic resins were specifically mentioned prior to the Tariff Act
of 1930.</p>

<p>The Tariff Act of 1922 (par. 28) provided for synthetic phenolic
resin and all resinlike products, solid, semisolid or liquid, prepared
from phenol, cresol, phthalic anhydride, coumarone, indene, or from
any other article or material provided for in paragraph 27 or 1549.
The rate of duty was 60 percent ad valorem based on American selling
price or United States value and 7 cents per pound, with a
provision that the ad valorem rate should be reduced to 45 percent
2 years after the passage of the act.</p>

<p>The Tariff Commission made two investigations of synthetic
resins under section 316 of the act of 1922. The first was undertaken
April 16, 1926, upon complaints of several domestic manufacturers,
of unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the
importation and sale of synthetic phenolic resin, Form C, and articles
made wholly or in part therefrom, in infringement of the patent
rights of the Bakelite Corporation. Following the investigation,
the Commission recommended on May 25, 1927, that this material
(as described under United States Patents No. 942,809 and 1,424,738)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
be excluded from entry into the United States. Importers appealed
from the findings of the Commission to the Court of Customs Appeals,
and the judicial proceedings were ended on October 13, 1930,
by denial of a writ of certiorari for the Supreme Court of the United
States to review the judgment of the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals. The latter court had held, among other things, that there
was substantial evidence in support of each finding of the Commission.
On November 26, 1930, the Treasury Department issued an
order prohibiting the importation of synthetic phenolic resin, Form
C, with certain exceptions. (T. D. 44411.)</p>

<p>The second investigation by the Tariff Commission was instituted
on December 23, 1927, also under section 316 of the act of 1922. It
concerned unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation
into the United States of laminated products of paper or
other materials and insoluble, infusible condensation products of
phenols and formaldehyde. The Commission recommended to the
President that, until March 4, 1929, inclusive, certain products covered
by United States Letters Patent Nos. 1,018,385, 1,019,406, and
1,037,719 be excluded from entry into the United States. These
products were laminated cloth, paper or the like, combined with insoluble,
infusible condensation products of phenols and formaldehyde.
The order of the President prohibiting the importation was
contained in T. D. 42801 issued June 11, 1928.</p>

<p>Under the Tariff Act of 1930, practically no changes were made in
the provisions of paragraph 28 that concern coal-tar synthetic resins.
Paragraph 2 was extended to include, among other things, the resins
(polymers) of certain organic compounds. The only commercial
products covered by this provision are the vinyl resins. The rate of
duty was 30 percent ad valorem on foreign value and 6 cents per
pound. Under the trade agreement with Canada, the duty on vinyl
acetate, polymerized or unpolymerized, and on synthetic resins made
in chief value therefrom was reduced to 15 percent ad valorem and
3 cents per pound (effective Jan. 1, 1936).</p>

<p>The Tariff Act of 1930 contains a provision, in paragraph 11, for
synthetic gums and resins not specially provided for, 4 cents per
pound and 30 percent ad valorem on foreign value.</p>

<h3 id="heading1-4">Broadening use of synthetic resins.</h3>

<p>The application of synthetic resins has extended into practically
every branch of industry. This marked expansion is not surprising
when the adaptability of these products is considered. Their uses
range from jewelry and bottle closures to building materials; from
adhesives and new types of surface coatings to light reflectors and
shades. They are being substituted for natural materials, such as
wood, metal, and glass at an increasing rate. They have provided
new uses for raw materials formerly used in antiseptics, disinfectants,
explosives, embalming fluids, fertilizers, moth repellants, and as
solvents. The speed of expansion of their use in resin manufacture
has been such as to create a serious shortage of some of these raw
materials.</p>

<p>New applications for synthetic resins appear almost daily. They
are used in furniture, wall panels, builders’ hardware, electrical fixtures,
and in thousands of small appliances. The automobile industry
is probably the largest single user. An interesting application here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
is in silent gears and shaft bearings where the use of synthetic resins
makes water lubrication possible. Other automotive uses are in
distributor heads, horn buttons, gear shift knobs, dome light reflectors,
control knobs and the finishing lacquers. Additional uses
contemplated for the near future are in accelerator pedals and instrument
panels. A new type of safety glass in which vinyl resins
are used was introduced in 1936.</p>

<p>In decorative uses remarkable progress has been made. Panels
of laminated resins are widely used in store fronts, lobbies of office
buildings, and hotels; doors faced with this material are in use.
The liner <i>Queen Mary</i> is paneled, in part, with laminated resins, as
is the annex to the Library of Congress. Lamp shades of urea resin
are used in many Pullman cars and are available for home and
office use.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, the cheaper a synthetic resin, the more
widely it may be applied as a substitute for other materials. As a
result many an apparently useless byproduct, such as oat hulls which
yield furfural, is either already used or being tested as a source
of raw material. Other materials which have already found a place
or may do so, are soybean meal, sugar, and certain petroleum
distillates.</p>

<p>Each of the important groups of synthetic resins has been sponsored
by one or more manufacturers of established reputation and
large capital resources. When a product reaches the commercial
stage, after heavy research cost, its future importance is therefore
usually assured.</p>

<h3 id="heading1-5">Relation of synthetic resins to their raw materials.</h3>

<p>Most of the commercially important synthetic resins are derived
directly or indirectly from coal. The chart (<a href="#illus1">p. 6</a>) shows the derivation
of certain synthetic resins from the principal raw materials used
in their manufacture and the intermediate products back to the original
source of the material.</p>

<p>The polystyrene resins, for example, are made by polymerizing
styrene or vinyl benzene. Although basically from ethylene and
benzene, vinyl benzene may be formed in several ways. Ethylene
is found in the gases from the destructive distillation of coal but is
obtained commercially by cracking natural gas or petroleum.
Styrene, found already formed in the light oil fractions from coal
tar, causes gum-forming in motor benzol and certain industrial
gases.</p>

<p>When coke and lime are mixed and heated in an electric furnace
to 2,000° C., calcium carbide is formed. This compound with water
yields acetylene, the starting point for a long list of important products,
including several types of synthetic resins. When acetylene gas
is passed through acetic acid (itself obtained from acetylene) vinyl
acetate is obtained. If hydrochloric acid is used instead of acetic
acid, vinyl chloride is obtained. These compounds, when polymerized,
yield the vinyl resins. The acrylate resins may be obtained
from the same basic raw material by an entirely different procedure.
Synthetic rubber is also derived from acetylene, as are acetic anhydride
and acetic acid (used in making cellulose acetate plastics)
and many other chemicals of commercial importance.</p>

<p class="caption">Derivation of certain synthetic resins.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>When naphthalene (from coal tar) is treated with air at elevated
temperatures, phthalic anhydride is formed. Substituting benzene
for naphthalene yields maleic anhydride. Both of these substances
when condensed with glycerin, a byproduct of the soap industry, yield
alkyd resins.</p>

<p>The tar acids from coal tar, either separated or mixed, when condensed
with formaldehyde give the highly important tar-acid resins.
Or if formaldehyde is condensed with urea, obtained from carbon
dioxide and ammonia, the urea resins are formed.</p>

<p>The chart indicates the synthetic resins which are thermoplastic,
that is, which become plastic again upon reheating, and those which
are thermosetting, that is, pass into an infusible stage at a certain
critical temperature and pressure and do not again become plastic
upon subsequent reheating.</p>

<h3 id="heading1-6">Sources of information.</h3>

<p>The data used in this report were obtained from a great variety of
sources. The several American and British trade journals were
freely consulted as were the various text books on this subject. Much
of the information on the domestic industry was obtained by personal
contact with producers and by correspondence. Field work
included visits to most of the domestic producers of resins and a
representative group of fabricators. Information of this type which
was nonconfidential or which could be combined so as not to reveal
individual operations was invaluable. Even where it was such that
it could not be published it became part of the general background.</p>

<p>The data pertaining to the industry in foreign countries were,
for the most part, furnished the Tariff Commission by Department
of Commerce representatives stationed abroad, in response to inquiries
by the Commission.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading2-1">Growth of the industry.</h3>

<p>The coal-tar synthetic resin industry in the United States began
on a small scale some years before the World War. The output
then was confined to a few types of tar-acid resins and the applications
were quite limited until 1927, when certain of the basic patents
expired. The output of about 1.5 million pounds in 1921 had increased
to more than 13 million pounds in 1927 and the average unit
value of sales had dropped from 81 cents per pound to 47 cents.
Production continued to increase and the unit value to decrease
annually until 1932 when general economic conditions forced a slight
curtailment for 1 year. Since then the annual increase in volume
and variety has been rapid. Production of non-coal-tar synthetic
resins was started on a small scale in 1929 when both urea and vinyl
resins entered the picture. Commercial production of the petroleum
resins began in 1936 and of the acrylate resins in 1937. Table <a href="#table1">1</a>
shows the production and sales of coal-tar resins and of non-coal-tar
resins, from 1921 through 1937.</p>

the resins not included was small.</p>

</div>

<p>Many factors have contributed to the growth of the synthetic
resin industry. Among these are the intensive research and development
work carried on by many individuals and firms; their
widespread application in many fields competing with wood, metal,
and glass; and the development of processes for raw materials which
have greatly reduced their cost and made their wider use possible.</p>

<p id="heading2-1-1"><i>Raw materials.</i>—Although the chief raw materials consumed in
the synthetic resin industry are coal-tar derivatives and formaldehyde,
many others are utilized. The rapid expansion of the industry
has created new demands for materials in increasing quantities and
has not only increased the markets for well-known materials but has
resulted in the production on a huge scale of materials entirely new
to commerce. Practically all the raw materials now used can be
derived from a few natural substances, such as air, water, coal, petroleum
crudes, salt, sulphur, and limestone. The air yields nitrogen
which may be converted to ammonia, a raw material for urea, one
of the components of the urea resins. Coal, as is well known, yields a
great variety of substances, many of which are essential to synthetic
resin manufacture. Benzene is the starting point for synthetic
phenol; naphthalene is used to make phthalic anhydride and maleic
anhydride; coke is converted to calcium carbide, which in turn yields
acetylene, acetic acid, and many other synthetics; carbon monoxide
which is converted to methanol and formaldehyde; and the natural
tar acids such as phenol, the cresols, and the xylenols. Limestone is
a component of calcium carbide, and salt yields needed alkalies and
acids. Water is broken down, and the hydrogen is converted to ammonia,
methanol, formaldehyde, and ethylene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Some idea of the expansion in production of these raw materials
whose principal use is in synthetic resins may be had by comparing
the output in 1923 of tar acids, formaldehyde, phthalic anhydride,
maleic anhydride, urea, vinyl acetate, and vinyl chloride, which
amounted to 35 million pounds, with the output of 270 million pounds
in 1936. The manufacture of these materials is largely by coal-tar
distilling companies and makers of chemicals.</p>

<p id="heading2-1-2"><i>Resins.</i>—The coal-tar resins are the most important in quantity,
value, and variety of application. This class includes four groups:
(<i>a</i>) tar acid, (<i>b</i>) alkyd, (<i>c</i>) coumarone and indene, and (<i>d</i>) polystyrene.
Of these, resins from tar acids (phenol, cresols, and xylenols)
are produced in the largest quantity, the output having increased
from about 15 million pounds in 1932 to about 80 million pounds in
1937. In the latter year about 40 percent of the consumption of tar
acid resins was in molded articles, 25 percent in paint and varnishes,
20 percent in laminated products, and 15 percent in miscellaneous
uses.</p>

<p>The alkyd resins have shown a remarkable increase in output.
Production totaled slightly less than 10 million pounds in 1933; in
1937 it amounted to about 61 million pounds. Practically all of the
alkyds have been consumed in paints and varnishes.</p>

<p>The coumarone and indene resins have increased steadily over a
number of years and are now one of the most important groups.</p>

<p>The polystyrene resins have been in an experimental stage for a
long time, with the volume of production small. In 1937, however,
commercial production of a water-white product was announced,
and it is believed that the output of these resins will increase sharply
in the near future.</p>

<p>The non-coal-tar resins were of little importance prior to 1930
and production amounted to less than 2 million pounds in 1932.
Since then, however, progress has been rapid, both in types and
output. Resins from urea constitute an important part of this
class and the output has increased practically every year since 1929
when production was started. Most of the output is used in molded
articles where light and pastel shades are required. In 1936, for the
first time, appreciable quantities were consumed in laminating and in
surface coatings.</p>

<p>The vinyl resins have been produced in increasing quantities for
the past 8 years. Production reached a new high in 1937, and with
the acceptance of this type of resin for safety glass laminations it is
expected that the output will increase materially in the near future.
In 1937 the application in surface coatings, molded articles, and
laminations were of approximately equal importance.</p>

<p>The acrylate resins are among the newest commercial developments
in this industry. Of the several types now manufactured, one
appears valuable in surface coatings and adhesives and another, in
the form of its cast or molded polymer, in airplane windows, machined
articles, and lenses.</p>

<p>Petroleum resins were first produced in commercial quantities in
1936, but the output in that year was appreciable. These low-priced
synthetics are used in surface coatings, laminations, and miscellaneous
uses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading2-2">The industry abroad.</h3>

<p>World production of synthetic resins at this time is estimated at
300 million pounds annually, of which the United States accounts
for 45 percent. Germany produces about 27 percent and Great
Britain about 20 percent of the total and a number of countries
including France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Canada, and Japan produce
the remainder. Practically all types are made in Germany and
Great Britain although in lesser quantities than here. The urea
resins originated abroad, as did the acrylates and polystyrenes.</p>

<p>Commercial development of the synthetic resins abroad has been
somewhat behind that in the United States, although in recent years
the increase there has been so rapid as to seriously affect the international
raw material market. Germany, formerly one of our principal
sources of crude naphthalene, for a time restricted exports of
that commodity in order to conserve the available supply for home
consumption, presumably in alkyd resins. Great Britain, formerly
the principal exporter of phenol, has found it necessary to supplement
production of natural phenol with synthetic phenol. It is
possible that in the future similar conditions may arise in world
markets for cresylic acid.</p>

<h3 id="heading2-3">International trade.</h3>

<p>International trade in the synthetic resins has been small. Germany
has been the principal exporting country. There are a number
of reasons for the negligible movement of these materials in international
trade, the chief of which are active home markets in the
principal producing countries; the existence of patents of a basic
nature which limited trade to the owners and licencees under them;
affiliation of producing companies in different countries with allocation
of the world market; and high tariff barriers in many countries.</p>

<p>The principal domestic producer of tar-acid resins is affiliated with
firms in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, and
Japan. The two principal American makers of urea resins have
or have had agreements as to patents, exchange of technical information,
and probably markets, with producers in Great Britain.
Similar conditions exist with other types of resins.</p>

<p>In 1937 production of all synthetic resins in the United States
amounted to 162 million pounds and imports to less than 674,000
pounds (see table <a href="#table13">13</a>, p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>). Production of tar-acid resins in that
year amounted to 79.8 million pounds; alkyd resins to 61.2 million
pounds and all coal-tar resins to 141 million pounds. Imports of
all coal-tar synthetic resins (which would include both tar acid and
alkyd as well as others) amounted to only 19,000 pounds. Coal-tar
resins are dutiable at 7 cents per pound and 45 percent ad valorem
based on American selling price. On the small imports in 1937 the
duty collected averaged 54 percent ad valorem on American selling
price and would have averaged much higher had it been calculated
upon foreign value as are most duties.</p>

<p>In 1937 the production of non-coal-tar resins totaled about 21
million pounds. In that year imports of non-coal-tar resins totaled
65,000 pounds. Imports of non-coal-tar resins, other than vinyl
resins, amounted to less than 2,000 pounds. These were dutiable at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
4 cents per pound and 30 percent ad valorem on foreign value, equivalent
on the average to 48 percent ad valorem. The vinyl resins have
been imported into the United States in increasing quantities in recent
years. The principal foreign producer, in Canada, developed markets
in the United States, but is a joint owner of a plant now under construction
in this country. Imports of vinyl resins in 1937 were 653,000
pounds. These were dutiable at 3 cents per pound and 15 percent ad
valorem on foreign value, equivalent to 25 percent ad valorem.</p>

<p>It is apparent that foreign competition with United States producers
in the home market has been and is likely to continue insignificant
under existing duties. With a large home market and generally
favorable conditions with respect to the necessary raw materials
and the technical skills, this situation would probably continue
even under lower duties. Moreover, as international trade develops in
these materials, this country is more likely to be a net exporter than
a net importer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading3">3. TAR-ACID RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The tar-acid resins were the first true synthetic resins to appear
in commerce, but they were preceded by two plastics, celluloid and
casein. Probably the first successful attempt to make a semisynthetic
or modified natural product as a substitute for natural materials
was the discovery of celluloid in 1868 by John Wesley Hyatt.
By treating cotton with nitric acid he obtained a material which
could be substituted for ivory in billiard balls. The Celluloid Corporation
grew out of this discovery and the product was widely used
to replace amber, ivory, mother-of-pearl, tortoise shell and other
materials.</p>

<p>The discovery of casein plastic took place in 1890. Adolph Spitteler
of Hamburg, Germany, in trying to make a white blackboard, found
that casein (from milk) could be hardened by treating it with
formaldehyde. Casein plastics are now widely used in buttons,
buckles, and other ornaments.</p>

<p>As early as 1872 the reactions between coal-tar acids and aldehydes
were being studied, and by 1900 many research workers were investigating
phenol-formaldehyde condensation products. During the
period 1900-1910, the study of these products increased greatly, both
with regard to process of production and to applications, such as its
substitution for shellac and other natural resins. United States Patents
Nos. 942,699 and 942,809 issued December 7, 1909, to Dr. L. H.
Baekeland and commonly known as the heat and pressure patents
were probably the basic patents on phenol-formaldehyde resins.
Baekeland so modified these resins by methods of hardening under
heat and pressure that rigid molded articles could be made. The
range of uses of tar-acid-formaldehyde molding compositions has
steadily widened. Molded articles such as pencil and pen barrels, ash
trays, bottle closures, parts for automobiles, cameras, precision instruments,
dynamos, motors, and other electrical equipment, cafeteria
trays, table and counter tops are well known to the public.</p>

<p>During the life of these and other basic patents issued about 1909
the domestic production of phenol-formaldehyde molding compositions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
was practically restricted to one company. Since the expiration
of these patents in 1926 a number of other producers have been
established. In 1937 there were 36 domestic makers of tar-acid-formaldehyde
resins for molding, laminating, and surface coating
applications.</p>

<p>The early work done on phenol-formaldehyde resins gave dark-colored
products which were too hard and brittle to be machined or
worked on a lathe. Investigations by F. Pollak and A. Ostersetzer,
in Vienna, resulted in a process for the manufacture of cast phenolic
resin with a range of color possibilities from water-white transparency
through all shades and degrees of translucency and opaqueness.
This product is cast into sheets, rods, tubes, and special castings, all
of which may be turned or milled on automatic machines. United
States Patent No. 1,854,600, issued April 19, 1932, to F. Pollak and
A. Ostersetzer and assigned to Pollopas, Ltd., London, is considered
the basic patent for cast phenolic resins. American rights under this
and related patents are owned by the Catalin Corporation of America
who have licensed other domestic makers. The German equivalent
of rights under this patent is owned by a subsidiary of I. G.
Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft and rights under the French
equivalent by Établissements Kuhlmann.</p>

<p>In the early days of the phenol-formaldehyde resin industry
(1909-16) there was considerable uneasiness about the supply of
phenol. World production was not large and Germany and England
controlled most of it. The output of the United States was almost
entirely for medicinal use, although our potential production was
large (see p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>). This situation caused many research workers to
study the resins made from other tar acids, principally meta and para
cresols and the xylenols. The investigations resulted in many new
types of resins and in modifications of the phenol-formaldehyde type.
The World War changed conditions materially. Imports of phenol
were shut off and prices soared. Production of synthetic phenol was
begun, and, although the wartime production went into explosives,
its development had an important bearing on the synthetic resin
industry. Unusual demand for phenol, toluene, and other coal-tar
crudes resulted in a great expansion of production. With the cessation
of hostilities there was an ample supply of cheap phenol and the
expansion of the coal-tar industry continued so that the supply of
tar acids kept pace with the new demand for use in the production of
synthetic resin.</p>

<p>In 1926, the early patents on resins from tar acids began to expire
and the second era of the industry began. Since that year most of
the research work has been for materials that would give different
properties to the resultant resins. The past 10 years have seen a
greater diversification in the manufacture of resins from tar acids
and substantial reductions in their prices. Tar-acid resins averaged
$1.29 per pound in 1920, 23 cents per pound in 1934, and 19 cents per
pound in 1937. The production of certain resins of this class which
are soluble in drying oils has been an important achievement. They
yield varnishes of improved type that are quick-drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading3-1">The three stages of a tar-acid resin.</h3>

<p>About 28 years ago the Journal of Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry published the original paper of Dr. Leo H. Baekeland on
the Synthesis, Constitution, and Uses of Bakelite. According to
Baekeland’s theory, the reaction between phenol and formaldehyde
consists of condensation and polymerization taking place in three
stages. The first product formed, called “initial condensation product
A” is usually a liquid or semisolid which on continued heating is
converted to “intermediate condensation product B.” B is an insoluble
solid which can be softened by heat, and is the material used by
molders, laminators, and other fabricators.</p>

<p>The final stage, known as “final condensation product C,” is probably
the result of polymerization of B, by heat and pressure. C product
is infusible, indifferent to all solvents, and cannot be distilled or
melted; hence the tar-acid resins belong to the thermosetting group.
The conversion to C takes place in the presses of the molder or final
fabricator of the resin. This theory is generally accepted and the
designations of the several stages are in universal use in the trade.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-2">Classification of tar-acid resins.</h3>

<p>All the synthetic resins obtained by the condensation of a tar acid,
or a mixture of tar acids, with an aldehyde are popularly called phenolic
resins, regardless of whether they are made from phenol, the
isomeric cresols, xylenols, other high boiling tar acids, or any mixture
of these materials. A more accurate designation and that used
in this survey is tar-acid resins, reserving the term phenolic resins
for those made from pure phenol.</p>

<p>The tar-acid resins might be classified in a number of ways; for
example, by composition, physical form, or general application. Each
of these has its shortcomings. To classify them by composition, that
is, by the kind of tar acid used, is not satisfactory because of the vast
number of types made from mixed tar acids. For the purpose of this
discussion it seems best to classify the tar-acid resins by their general
application into six groups: for molding, for casting, for laminating,
for surface coating (paints, varnishes, and lacquers), for adhesives,
and for miscellaneous uses.</p>

<p>In 1937 approximately 66 percent of the United States production
of tar-acid resins was made from phenol; 18 percent from phenol-cresol
mixtures; 13 percent from cresol-cresylic acid mixtures; and 3
percent from cresol-xylenol mixtures. Table <a href="#table2">2</a> shows for recent years
production and sales of tar-acid resins by type of raw material. Pure
phenol is used for cast resins. Molding resins are usually made from
pure phenol or from tar-acid mixtures, chiefly phenol. Laminating
and coating resins are usually made from mixtures containing substantial
amounts of the cresols and xylenols (frequently spoken of by
the trade as cresylic acid).</p>

<h3 id="heading3-3">Processes of resin manufacture.</h3>

<p>The processes of and patents for the manufacture of tar-acid-formaldehyde
resins are numerous. No attempt is made here to describe
in detail the several processes of manufacture or the endless number
of variations and modifications. In general the processes in operation
may be designated (<i>a</i>) one stage wet, (<i>b</i>) two stage wet, and (<i>c</i>)
dry.</p>

<p>The one-stage wet process consists in heating molecular proportions
of tar acid and formaldehyde (40-percent solution) in the presence
of an acid or alkaline catalyst. The formaldehyde is added all at
once and the reaction proceeds with the elimination of water. The
difficulty with this process is that of obtaining uniform batches
because it cannot be controlled exactly.</p>

<p>The two-stage process is probably the one most widely used today
and consists in introducing formaldehyde in two or more stages as the
reaction progresses. Much better process control and more uniform
results are so obtained. A soluble, fusible resin is formed from which
the water is easily removed. Fillers and pigments may be added
during the latter part of the operation.</p>

<p>The dry process is the least important and is used only where
cast resins are being made. Light-colored, transparent resins are
obtained and the operation is carried on to the final stage (C resin).
In this process the aldehyde used is solid paraformaldehyde or hexamethylenetetramine.
These materials are more costly than formaldehyde
solution.</p>

<p>Proportions of raw materials used vary widely—Baekeland suggested
7 mols of formaldehyde and 6 mols of phenol (210 parts of
100-percent formaldehyde to 564 parts of phenol), with a yield of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
resin equivalent to 118 percent of the phenol. Larger proportions
of formaldehyde are said to increase the yield to as much as 140
percent of the phenol.</p>

<p>Catalysts used to aid in the condensation of the reacting bodies
may be acids or bases. Certain properties of the resins may be
varied by the kind and quantity of catalyst used. Large proportions
of basic or acidic catalysts may affect the filler or metal inserts.
Basic catalysts used include caustic soda, caustic potash, ammonia,
carbonates, and alkali sulphites. Acid catalysts are usually one of the
mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>While formaldehyde in the form of a 40-percent solution is the
principal aldehyde used with the tar acids, certain other aldehydes
are used in small amounts. Among these are acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde,
benzaldehyde, and others. Resins from furfural and
phenol are discussed as “Furfural Resins,” page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-4">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>The production of tar-acid resins in the United States has increased
markedly in the last 10 years. Table <a href="#table3">3</a> shows the production
and sales of all coal-tar resins in 1927 and 1928 (when there was no
further break-down available but when this classification was made
up chiefly of tar-acid resins) and of tar-acid resins from 1929 to
1937. The figures given are in net resin content and do not include
fillers, modifiers, or pigments. From 1929 to 1937 production increased
from 26 million pounds to 80 million pounds; sales from 25
million pounds valued at 9.9 million dollars to 74 million pounds
valued at 13.3 million dollars; the value per pound dropped from 39
cents to 19 cents.</p>

<p>In 1937 the production of tar-acid resins for molding accounted
for about 40 percent of the total; those for surface coatings, about
25 percent; those for lamination, about 20 percent; and those for
miscellaneous uses, about 15 percent.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-5">Imports into the United States.</h3>

<p>Imports of tar-acid resins into the United States are dutiable under
paragraph 28 at 7 cents per pound and 45 percent ad valorem based
upon American selling price. Discussion of this rate, other restrictions
upon imports in the earlier years, and of the rates upon articles
made of these resins will be found on pages <a href="#Page_59">59 to 61</a>.</p>

<p>Imports of tar-acid resins are not shown separately in official
statistics; the classification under which such imports are entered
includes all synthetic resins of coal-tar origin. Table <a href="#table4">4</a> shows the
quantity and value of imports of all coal-tar resins since 1918, and
table <a href="#table5">5</a> shows the principal sources of imports for certain years.</p>

<p>Invoice analyses of imports in the last 3 years show only very
small quantities of phenolic resins being imported. In 1934 there
was an importation of 950 pounds of Bakelite molding compound; in
1935 imports of 100 pounds of molding compound and 22 pounds of
aminophenol resin are recorded, and in 1936 imports of Bakelite filament
compound totaled 250 pounds and other resins 8,851 pounds.</p>

<p>Even if in the years up to 1933 all of the imports of resins of
coal-tar origin were tar-acid resins, imports of tar-acid resins have
been negligible when compared with production. The smallness of
imports may be accounted for by a combination of factors, (1) the
prohibition of imports of certain types, which conflicted with patent
rights; (2) the rate of duty upon imports; (3) the fact that the
manufacture of tar-acid resins developed more rapidly in the United
States than in most foreign countries; and (4) the allocation of
markets through agreements between affiliated producers in different
countries. (See p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="heading3-6">Exports from the United States.</h3>

<p>Appreciable quantities of phenolic resins are exported annually in
the form of molding compounds and as finished articles of wide
variety. Statistics of these exports are not compiled separately by
the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>Exportation is limited by a number of factors, such as licensing
agreements, patents, allocation of markets, and high tariffs or embargoes
in certain countries. The largest domestic maker is affiliated
with producers in Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
Canada, and Japan. Other domestic firms have agreements as to
patents and markets with producers in England, Germany, and other
countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading3-7">TAR-ACID RESINS FOR MOLDING</h3>

<p>The tar-acid resins were first developed for molding and they are
still used in large volume in this way. An article produced in large
quantity is more likely to be made of molded resin. The cost of the
mold, which may amount to several thousand dollars, then becomes
very small per unit produced. If the article is of such a shape that it
would require a great deal of labor to produce in metal or wood, it
may be produced in quantity much more cheaply from resin, since
it will come from the mold almost in finished form.</p>

<p>A few of the large molders find it economical to make their own
resins when they use one type in large volume or desire some special
modification. Most of the molders buy resins for molding in the form
of either powder or pre-formed pellets ready for use.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-7-1">Molding powders and pellets.</h4>

<p>Molding powder is made from B-stage resin (see p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>), a filler,
a pigment, a lubricant, and a plasticizer. These materials are mixed
and put through rolls at a moderate heat and pressure. The resin
softens and amalgamates with the other materials. It hardens upon
cooling and is ground to powder. A pre-formed pellet may be made
from the powder by pressure; use in this form saves the time of the
molder when filling the mold, since he is not required to measure the
powder.</p>

<p>The proper selection of the filler in a molding powder is important
in influencing the quality of the molded article. Fibrous fillers improve
the mechanical strength and shock resistance of the finished
article. Wood flour is the most widely used filler in tar-acid resins
as well as in other thermosetting resins. Pine, spruce, and fir are
the principal kinds used, and consideration must be given to the
bulk, gum content, color, and the size and shape of the wood particles.
Color is the least important since most of the tar-acid resins
give brown or black moldings. When the molding must withstand
high temperatures, asbestos fiber is used as a filler. In articles requiring
high shock resistance, such as golf club heads, a filler of
paper pulp is used. Where high electrical insulation and dielectric
properties are required, ground mica is used as the filler. Certain
inorganic fillers such as powdered slate, gypsum, barium sulphate,
calcium sulphate, china clay, zinc oxide, and infusorial earths, are
sometimes used. Large proportions of these may be used where
hardness is more important than strength, as in phonograph records.
Other materials used include rubber, graphite, horn, bone, starch,
pumice, and cork.</p>

<p>Coloring matter used may be coal-tar dyes or pigments such as
bone black, carbon black, and iron oxides. Pigments are usually
more satisfactory, although dyes are sometimes preferred in articles
for insulation.</p>

<p>A lubricant is added to the molding mixture to overcome the tendency
to stick in the mold. Metallic soaps, stearates, and stearic acid
are those most commonly used.</p>

<p>Sometimes a plasticizer is included, its function being to act as a
solvent for the resin, thus increasing the flow of the material in the
mold. The plasticizer should be one which will become infusible or
at least remain solid in the molded article.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-7-2">The molding of tar-acid resins.</h4>

<p>Ordinarily the molds used are made of hardened steel, highly polished.
They must stand working pressures of several thousand
pounds per square inch. The mold is placed in a hydraulic press,
heated by steam, electricity, or gas, and the molding material is
placed in the mold. The press is closed and heat and pressure are
applied. The temperatures used range between 250° F. and 365° F.,
and the pressures between 1,000 and 8,000 pounds per square inch.
The molding time depends on the shape and size of the article and
on the composition of the molding material. As little as one-half
minute is required for small objects and as long as 10 minutes for
large objects. Average molding time is about 3 minutes. The article
is removed from the mold, allowed to cool, and is then trimmed,
sanded, filed, or polished. Since the mold is highly polished, the finishing
operation is usually needed only to remove the flash. Inserts,
such as metal parts (binding posts, electrical contacts, etc.), or inlays
of polished metal in name plates, and signs, are often molded in; gear
shift knobs are molded over a hollow metal core; rubber inserts are
used in castors, electrical plugs, and similar objects.</p>

<p>The molding operation is an art, and has made remarkable progress
in recent years. Many articles molded of tar-acid resins are
well-known to the public. The automotive industry is the best customer,
using such molded parts as gear shift knobs, horn buttons,
accelerator pedals, light switches, ignition parts, and distributor
heads. Other well-known applications are builders’ hardware, electrical
switch plates, switches and fixtures, fountain pens, radio parts,
telephone parts, handles for stoves, vacuum cleaners, and other appliances,
buttons, buckles, costume jewelry, camera cases, radio cabinets,
small containers, and hundreds of others.</p>

<p>The importance of tar-acid resins in molded articles is shown by
the fact that more than 75 percent of all synthetic resin molded
articles made in 1937 used this type of resin as a binder.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-7-3">Production of tar-acid molding resins.</h4>

<p>Domestic production of tar-acid molding powders and pellets was
reported to the Tariff Commission by 15 makers in 1937. Most of
these firms have specialized in resin development and manufacture.
Among the well-known brands are Bakelite, Durez, Durite, Resinox,
Indur, and others (see p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a> for list of trade names).</p>

<p>Statistics of production and sales of tar-acid resins used in molding
were collected separately for the first time in 1935. They show
a net resin output of about 21,000,000 pounds, with sales of 18,000,000
pounds or about 40 percent of the total tar-acid resins. The average
unit value was 17 cents per pound. In 1937 the production of tar-acid
resins for molding exceeded 32,000,000 pounds, again about 40
percent of the total. These statistics are based on net resin and do
not include fillers, modifiers, pigments, or inert material of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading3-8">CAST PHENOLIC RESINS</h3>

<h4 id="heading3-8-1">Process of manufacture.</h4>

<p>The production of cast phenolic resins requires pure materials, expensive
equipment, and extreme care in the control of the operation.
A mixture of phenol and formaldehyde and a catalyst (usually sodium
or potassium hydroxide) is charged into a nickel-lined reaction
kettle and heated until the water separates and is removed. The
reaction is then allowed to proceed to the desired point. Glycerin is
added to aid in forming a transparent product. All equipment, including
pipe lines, valves, and pumps, is nickel or nickel lined except
that used for formaldehyde, which is made of aluminum.</p>

<p>The resin is usually made in 1,000 pound batches, and the reaction
cycle ranges from 6 to 18 hours. It is colored with soluble coal-tar
dyes and cast into lead molds. These are placed in a heated room
and allowed to cure for 3 to 6 days. The resin is removed from the
mold with air hammers, and the lead molds are melted.</p>

<p>The appearance of the resin may be changed by varying its water
content, by the addition of dyes and fillers, and by the addition of
other substances to produce some desired effect, such as imitation
ivory or marble. The clarity of the resin depends upon its water
content—the greater the degree of dehydration the clearer the product.
Range of colors is complete, from crystal clear to the darker
shades, with any degree of transparency, translucency, or opaqueness.</p>

<p>Casting is in the form of sheets, rods, tubes, or special forms suitable
for the production of buckles, jewelry, and other small products.
Molds of complicated shape cannot be used, which means that most
articles if produced of cast resin must be produced from standard
shapes by subsequent working. Recently small radio cabinets have
been cast.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-8-2">Uses.</h4>

<p>Cast phenolic resin can be machined in the same manner as hard
wood. It must be polished after machining, usually by tumbling
with shoe pegs and pumice or with muslin wheels. The smooth finish
and low degree of heat conduction give the material a pleasant
feel, not cold to the touch as is metal. The coloring is not superficial
and therefore does not chip or wear off. Electrical properties
are excellent. A slow polymerization continues for some time after
fabrication, resulting in slight shrinkage.</p>

<p>Cast phenolic resins are marketed by the producers as rods, sheets,
cylinders, and special castings. Standard round rods range from ⅜
inch to more than 5 inches in diameter. Special rods are available
in such forms as square, hexagon, octagon, and fluted. Standard
sheets are in sizes from 12 by 24 inches to 36 by 72 inches, and from
⅛ to 1 inch thick. Stock cylinders are available in a wide range of
inside and outside diameters.</p>

<p class="caption-source">Source: Bakelite Corporation, 247 Park Avenue, New York, N. Y.</p>
</div>

<p>Stock material is fabricated by a number of firms into an endless
variety of articles. Among these are toilet articles such as combs,
backs for brushes, cosmetic containers, and trinkets; fittings for
automobiles, electrical appliances, furniture, and display fixtures;
jewelry, dress ornaments, clock cases, handbag frames, vanity cases,
smokers’ articles, signs and advertising specialties, picture frames,
handles for cutlery, chessmen, pens, desk penholders, pencils, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
many others. Probably the largest consumption is in the making
of buttons and buckles.</p>

<p>The cast phenolic resins are odorless, tasteless, nonflammable, resistant
to oils and greases, and practically nonbreakable.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-8-3">Patents and licensing.</h4>

<p>The basic patent covering the manufacture of cast phenolic resins
is United States Patent No. 1,854,600, issued April 19, 1932, to F.
Poliak and A. Ostersetzer, of Vienna, and assigned to Pollopas, Ltd.,
of London. Many other patents have been granted on variations and
modifications of this one. The basic process is also patented in England,
France, Germany, and other countries.</p>

<p>United States and Canadian patent rights were purchased by the
American Catalin Corporation; German rights by the Interessen
Gemeinschaft Industrie A. G. (German I. G.); French rights by
Kuhlmann Co., and British rights by the Imperial Chemical Industries.
These licensing arrangements limited the licensee to sales in
his own and, in some instances, nearby countries.</p>

<p>The American Catalin Corporation has successfully defended the
validity of this patent and has licensed a number of domestic manufacturers
to produce cast phenolic resins on a royalty basis.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were seven domestic makers of cast phenolic resins
located in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.
These firms produce and market resins under the following
trade names: Catalin, Prystal, Joanite, Fiberlon, Phenolin, and Marblette.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-8-4">Production of cast phenolic resins.</h4>

<p>Production was initiated about 1929 by the American Catalin
Corporation. The output increased substantially every year from
that year through 1933. Statistics of production and sales are not
publishable for the years prior to 1934 because they would reveal the
operations of individual firms; they are given in table <a href="#table6">6</a> for subsequent
years.</p>

<p>The licensing agreements, as outlined above, provide for the
allocation of markets for cast phenolic resins. Because of this arrangement
there are little or no imports and exports of this material.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-9">TAR-ACID RESINS FOR LAMINATING</h3>

<p>By laminating is meant the impregnation of sheets of paper, fiber,
or cloth with a solution of synthetic resin and the building up of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
these layers into sheets of reinforced synthetic resin of various thicknesses.
When a tar-acid resin is used the paper or cloth is immersed
in or coated with a solution of the B-stage resin, dried, and layers of
the material are compressed and consolidated, under heat and pressure
to form sheets, rods, tubes, blocks, and other forms, in the
infusible C-stage.</p>

<p>The coating of sheets of paper with solutions of natural resin and
the compacting of these sheets by heat and pressure is an old practice,
especially for electrical uses. Shellac and copal have been widely
used and yield a laminated board of good electrical and mechanical
properties when used at temperatures under 70° C. Above 70° C.
the resin softens and the desirable properties are lost. Since temperatures
above 70° C. are not uncommon in electrical equipment,
the limitations of these natural resins in this use can readily be seen.
The use of tar-acid resins to impregnate insulation material removes
the temperature limitation and otherwise improves the product; insulators
so made are widely used in all sorts of electrical and radio
equipment.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-9-1">Uses of tar-acid resin laminated products.</h4>

<p>Laminated sheets of tar-acid resin are made with paper, canvas,
duck, linen, pulpboard, vulcanized fiber, plywood, and other materials.
Paper is the material generally used for electrical insulation,
although cloth is sometimes used when greater strength is
needed. Canvas is used where maximum strength is required, as in
gears for automobiles and industrial machinery. Impregnated linen
is adapted to punched parts and small gears.</p>

<p>These laminated materials are uniformly dense, tough, resilient
and light in weight. They are nonabsorptive, have low thermal conductivity,
and a low coefficient of expansion. Their dielectric
strength is excellent and chemically they are inert to oils, brine, most
acids, weak alkalies, and many solvents. Structurally they are strong
under tension, compression, flexion, or impact; they are easy to machine
and are sound absorbing.</p>

<p>Gears made of laminated canvas are widely used; they are silent
and outwear those made of metal. The development of such gears
was brought about by the demand for a positive drive without the
clash and clatter resulting from metal to metal contact. The laminated
gear absorbs vibrations, eliminates noise, and reduces wear.
The laminated material is one-seventh the weight of brass, one-sixth
the weight of steel, one-fifth the weight of cast iron and one-half the
weight of aluminum. Laminated gear blanks may be cut on automatic
machines into helical, spur, bevel, or worm gears.</p>

<p>Timing gears in automobiles are frequently of this type; they
require no adjustment and seldom need replacement during the life
of the motor. The light weight of the material reduces to a minimum
flywheel effect on the camshaft. Where lubrication is difficult
a graphite impregnated blank may be used.</p>

<p>Bearings made from laminated fabric are successfully used in
heavy rolling mills where they reduce replacement costs and decrease
power consumption. The laminated material possesses
strength, smooth surface, density, good load carrying capacity, high
impact resistance, nonscoring properties, and is practically frictionless.
Power consumption is said to be reduced as much as 40 to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
60 percent of that of metal bearings and the life of the laminated
bearing has been as much as 10 times that of the metal ones. It
replaces Babbitt metal, brass, bronze, white metal, gun metal, or
lignum vitae in this application.</p>

</div>

<p>In decorative uses, laminated materials have made remarkable
progress in recent years. In this application the material made
from laminated paper is veneered on wood or fiber board, and the
surface is so durable that refinishing is probably not necessary during
the life of the equipment. Table tops for public rooms such as
restaurants, cafeterias, and bars are widely used because of the
beautiful designs obtainable and because the material is not discolored
by lighted cigarettes, alcohol or other liquids, and does not
chip or crack. Laminated sheets are used for bathroom and kitchen
walls, doors, window sills, store and theater fronts, lobby walls in
hotel and office buildings, and counter tops in banks and post offices.
The liner <i>Queen Mary</i> is equipped with panels of this material as
is also the new Library of Congress Annex. Most of the leading
hotels have installed bar and cocktail lounges of laminated materials
because of the range of color and the ease with which novel
designs may be carried out.</p>

<p>Almost any solid color, design, or imitation of another material
may be given the laminated sheet simply by printing it upon the top
sheet of paper used in the impregnated assembly. Thus a beautiful
piece of walnut or mahogany may be photographed, inexpensively
reproduced upon paper, and the finished laminated sheet will closely
imitate the polished wood. The combination of beauty with long
life should permit the widespread use of this type of material in
all sorts of building and equipment. It has been suggested as a
possibility in automobile body construction.</p>

<p>Other important uses are in trim and door strips for mechanical
refrigerators, in cafeteria trays, buckets and special containers, tires
for factory trucks, textile spools, miners’ safety helmets, gaskets,
valve discs and rings for pumps, pulleys, besides many others.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-9-2">Production of tar-acid resins for laminating.</h4>

<p>Statistics of production and sales of synthetic resins for laminating
were not separately compiled prior to 1935. Since that year the
resins made from cresylic acid have been used to the greatest extent
in laminating, followed by those made from phenol. Tar-acid resins
reported as “used in paints, varnishes, and lacquers” may include
appreciable quantities of resin varnishes used for laminating. The
total production and sale in 1937 of tar-acid resins used in laminating,
therefore, would be the sum of the 20 percent of the total (see table
<a href="#table3">3</a>) reported for laminating plus some part of the 25 percent reported
for surface coatings.</p>

<p>Domestic producers of tar-acid resins for laminating are located
in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania. The makers of the laminated materials are located
in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Indiana, and Connecticut. Their products are marketed under a
number of trade names, including Micarta, Dilecto, Celoron, Formica,
Textolite, Phenolite, Insurok, Spauldite, Synthane and Phenol
Fibre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<h4 id="heading3-9-3">Imports into the United States.</h4>

<p>There has been practically no importation of synthetic resins for
laminating. Imports of laminated products (rods, tubes, blocks,
strips, blanks, or other forms) of which synthetic resin is the chief
binding agent totaled only 215 pounds, valued at $612 in 1931 (principally
from the United Kingdom); 13 pounds, valued at $71 in 1932;
none in 1933 and 1934; 609 pounds, valued at $579 in 1935 from Canada,
Germany, and the Netherlands; and 3,260 pounds, valued at
$9,468 in 1936 from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-9-4">Exports from the United States.</h4>

<p>Exports of phenolic or other synthetic resins for laminating and of
laminated articles are not separately recorded in official statistics.
It is known that appreciable quantities of laminated articles are
exported to Canada, England, and other countries.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-10">TAR-ACID RESINS FOR SURFACE COATINGS</h3>

<p>Synthetic resins are widely used for surface coatings, chiefly because
of the ease with which new types can be produced to meet
special requirements and because of their uniformity. Tar-acid resin
coatings may be varied in composition and properties to meet a
particular purpose. Possible variations depend on the type or mixture
of tar acid used (phenol, cresols, xylenols, tertiary amyl phenol,
tertiary butyl phenol, phenyl phenol), whether the condensation
takes place in the presence of an acid or an alkali, and on the proportion
of formaldehyde used. The resin so formed may be modified
with natural resins, synthetic resins of the alkyd type, fatty acids, or
other materials. The almost endless opportunities for different types
can, therefore, readily be appreciated.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-10-1">Types of resin used and the resultant coatings.</h4>

<p>The tar-acid resins used in varnishes and other surface coatings are
usually oil-soluble types. They may be divided into three general
classes: (1) Phenol-formaldehyde condensation products rendered
oil-soluble by chemical combination or physical dispersion in other
materials, such as rosin and copal; (2) condensation products made
from tar acids other than simple phenol, which are themselves soluble
in drying oils and thinners; and (3) products from the condensation
of the substituted phenols and formaldehyde. These three
classes of oil-soluble tar-acid resins differ widely in their chemical
and physical properties and in their functions. The first group are
usually called modified phenolic resins, the second group are referred
to as unmodified or 100-percent soluble, and the third group are
known as substituted phenolic resins.</p>

<p>The unmodified resins are extensively used in long-oil tung varnishes,
to which they impart greater drying speed, durability, and
resistance to alkalis and gases. The modified types impart the same
properties to tung oil varnishes but to a lesser extent. In addition
the modified types possess considerable hardness so that greater gloss
and fullness are obtained. Modifiers are either drying oils or natural
resins; tung oil is the most widely used oil and rosin the principal
natural resin. Substituted phenols such as para tertiary amyl phenol
and para tertiary butyl phenol may be used in place of simple
phenol; while these are relatively high priced components, the resins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
made therefrom have increased in recent years to an appreciable
volume because of their improved properties.</p>

<p>Other synthetic resins, such as those of the alkyd, petroleum, urea,
and vinyl types, are sometimes incorporated with the phenolics in
the same surface coating to obtain some desired property. The addition
of a plasticizer, such as tricresyl phosphate or dibutyl phthalate,
improves the flexibility of the film.</p>

<p>Spirit varnishes, in which the synthetic resin is dissolved in a
solvent, are also available. In this type the soluble fusible resin
(form A) is dissolved in an organic solvent such as acetone or the
various alcohols, and conversion of the resin to the insoluble, infusible
state (form C) is effected by baking the film.</p>

<p>Coatings made from tar-acid resins are widely used in so-called
4-hour enamels and varnishes, for both interior and exterior application.
They are also used in the manufacture of linoleum, artificial
leather, adhesives, and printing inks. When incorporated with nitrocellulose
or cellulose acetate lacquers they improve the adhesion,
luster, and resistance to alkalies.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-10-2">Production in the United States.</h4>

<p>In 1937 the output of tar-acid resins for surface coatings exceeded
20 million pounds (net resin). Those from phenol and the substituted
phenols accounted for a very large part of the total. They
were followed by resins from cresylic acids and the xylenols in that
order.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were about 20 domestic makers of this type of synthetic
resin, with factories located in California, Connecticut, Illinois,
Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.</p>

<h4 id="heading3-10-3">Imports into and exports from the United States.</h4>

<p>Imports of oil-soluble phenolic resins have been negligible. This
is due, in part, to licenses and agreements between certain domestic
and foreign makers, to the remarkable advancement and pioneering
work done in this country, to the holding of many basic patents by
Americans, and to the relatively high duty on imports.</p>

<p>Exports of these products, usually in the form of enamels, varnishes,
and lacquers, have been appreciable and are probably increasing each
year. Official statistics are not reported separately.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-11">TAR-ACID RESINS IN ADHESIVES</h3>

<p>A comparatively new use for tar-acid resins is in the manufacture
of wood adhesives. Ordinary vegetable and animal glues have long
been used, although their deficiencies in certain characteristics are
well known. These include (a) their inability to produce uniform
products, (b) the tendency of most alkaline glues to stain wood, (c)
the bad effects of moisture on them, and of bacteria and fungi in the
case of animal glues. The tar-acid resins have none of these objectionable
qualities. Being chemically inert they are free from attack by
fungi and bacteria. Moisture does not affect them, and they do not
stain wood.</p>

<p>Three types of resins are used as wood adhesives, principally in
bonding plywoods and veneers: (1) Hot press liquid, (2) cold press
liquid, and (3) resin film. Furniture, radio cabinets, games, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
building products constructed from plywoods bonded with resins can
be shipped to tropical countries, the bond not being affected by
extreme climatic conditions.</p>

<p>These resin adhesives are more expensive than the usual animal
and vegetable glues, a factor which has limited their application.
Their advantages may, however, open up to resin bonded plywoods
uses in which the more ordinary types are not satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="heading3-12">TAR-ACID RESINS FOR OTHER USES</h3>

<p>The application of tar-acid resins in casting, molding, laminating,
surface coatings, and adhesives has been described. There are many
other uses, but most of them approach the types of application dealt
with.</p>

<p>Impregnation of all sorts of materials with tar-acid resins is an
increasing use; such applications are in fabrics for aircraft, crease
resistant textiles, wood, asbestos, concrete, and electrical coils. Wood
with resin forced into the fiber under pressure is used for furniture,
flooring, heads for golf clubs, and handles for utensils. Resin
is used as a binder in the manufacture of brake linings for automobiles,
as well as in the manufacture of abrasive and grinding wheels.</p>

<p>An interesting application is in the construction of corrosion-resistant
chemical plant equipment. In 1922 the German firm of
Saureschutz Gesellschaft was incorporated to fabricate equipment
composed of a special acid-resisting type of phenolic resin and
asbestos. Sometime later its manufacture was started in the United
States. All sorts of industrial plant equipment is now available,
including cylindrical and rectangular tanks up to 9 feet in diameter
and 12 feet high, piping for corrosive liquids and gases, valves,
pumps, fans and ventilators, filter press plates and frames, buckets,
dippers, etc.</p>

<p>Another new use is for making matrices in which to mold rubber
printing plates. Such plates are used at present chiefly in printing
cotton and paper bags but extensive experimentation promises to
broaden their use. The matrix is made of fiber board of very open
structure impregnated with tar-acid resin in the process of manufacture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading4">4. ALKYD RESINS</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="heading4-1">Description and uses.</h3>

<p>The alkyd resins, used principally in paints, varnishes, and lacquers,
are a group of condensation products synthesized by reacting polyhydric
alcohols, such as glycerin and the glycols, with dibasic organic
acids, such as phthalic, maleic, succinic, and sebacic. The condensation
product is almost always modified to give properties to the
resin desirable or essential to the specific application contemplated.
The modifying agent may be a drying, semidrying, or nondrying
oil; the fatty acid of an oil; a natural resin, such as rosin; a
synthetic resin of the tar-acid group or of the urea-formaldehyde
type; or other substance. Up to the present time unmodified alkyd
resins have not been commercially important.</p>

<p>A wide variety of types is obtained by the use of different materials
and different modifiers. The variations begin with the dibasic
acid used, and with the polyhydric alcohol used. The modifications
possible are practically endless, and almost any fixed oil or the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
fatty acid, and most of the natural or synthetic resins may be
used. The importance of the modifier is shown by the proportion
used in most alkyd resins. On the average, approximately 50 percent
of the total weight of the drying and semidrying alkyd resin products
is modifier, 30 percent dibasic acid, and 20 percent polyhydric alcohol.
The proportions will, of course, vary with individual types. Certain
types on the market contain only 25 percent modifier while others
have as much as 75 percent.</p>

<p>In a new industry such as this, rapid changes in types and applications
must be expected. Extensive research is being carried on
by various groups. The raw material makers are seeking cheaper
products or those with special properties; the resin makers are investigating
an endless number of modifications, and the makers of
surface coatings are testing most of the new types offered.</p>

<h3 id="heading4-2">Development and patents.</h3>

<p>Probably the earliest record of research leading to the development
of the alkyds was that of van Bemmelen, who reported in a
German technical journal in 1856 the sirupy products obtained by
heating together succinic acid and glycerin or citric acid and glycerin.
The first investigation of the phthalic anhydride-glycerin resins
was recorded in 1901.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Watson Smith, while engaged in research on
phthalein dyes, obtained a transparent, highly refractive resinlike
substance when glycerin and phthalic anhydride were heated together.
Smith recommended the product as a cement for ceramic
wares.</p>

<p>During the period 1910-16 the research laboratories of the General
Electric Co., engaged in research on a synthetic resin from glycerin
and phthalic anhydride. As a result of these studies numerous patents
were granted for this type of resin to which the trade name
Glyptal was applied. Intensive research was carried on by several
firms, many variations were developed, and literally hundreds of
patents were granted.</p>

<p>The paint and varnish industry has been undergoing radical
readjustment. Methods and natural products, which for decades or
centuries had changed very little, are giving way to synthetic creations
of our laboratories. The first important departure from the
traditional practices was the development of nitrocellulose lacquers.
The commercial application of the alkyd resins followed, and their
use is increasing rapidly. Because this development is still comparatively
young, the large number of modifications offered has confused
the coating manufacturer. It is probable that many of the
synthetic products now being marketed have no special technical or
economic justification and that they will in time lose out in competition
with better products known at present, or still to be developed.</p>

<p>United States Patent No. 1,893,873, dated January 10, 1933, granted
to R. H. Kienle and assigned to the General Electric Co., was considered
one of the basic patents in this field. Early in 1936 it was
declared invalid in a suit claiming infringement brought against
the Paramet Chemical Co. of Brooklyn, N. Y. The decision in this
case seems to have opened the glycerin-phthalic anhydride resins to
a large number of manufacturers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Among the principal brands of alkyd resins now on the domestic

<h3 id="heading4-3">Classification of alkyd resins.</h3>

<p>A number of classifications of the alkyd resins are possible and
practical. Since by far the most important applications are in surface
coatings, and their use in molding compositions is relatively
unimportant, it seems advisable at this time to emphasize the more
important use. For the purpose of this survey the following classification
is used:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Drying alkyd resins.</li>
<li class="isub1">(a) Unmodified.</li>
<li class="isub1">(b) Modified with natural materials.</li>
<li class="isub1">(c) Modified with other synthetic resins.</li>
<li class="isub1">(d) Modified with other synthetic resins and oil extended.</li>
<li>(2) Semidrying alkyd resins.</li>
<li>(3) Nondrying alkyd resins.</li>
<li>(4) Miscellaneous modified alkyd resins.</li>
<li>(5) Alkyd resins in water dispersion.</li>
<li>(6) Alkyd resins in molding compositions.</li>
</ul>

<p>At least 75 percent of the alkyd resin finishes used at present are
of the drying type and about 15 percent of the nondrying type.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-1"><i>Unmodified drying alkyd resins.</i>—This class of alkyd resins consists
of a series of compounds made from polyhydric alcohols, polybasic
acids, and fatty acids in chemical combination. The alcohol is
usually glycerin, and the polybasic acid largely phthalic anhydride
or acid, although others, such as maleic anhydride (acid) are increasing
rapidly in importance. The fatty acid or oil used may be linseed,
tung, perilla, hempseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower, or other
drying oil. It is believed that tung oil and perilla oil are the most
important at this time.</p>

<p>Unmodified drying alkyd resins are characterized by excellent durability
but limited resistance to water in air-dried finishes. Both in
air-dried and in baked finishes they are outstanding as to flexibility,
quick drying, long luster life, and permanent adhesion. Their principal
uses are in finishes for interior walls and woodwork, automobiles,
coatings on steel such as for refrigerators, railway equipment,
bridges, advertising signs, and lithographed containers. In these applications
the products of this type compete with nitrocellulose
lacquers and the older types of varnishes and paints. While the
initial cost is higher, greater durability is obtained together with
faster drying, flexibility, and hardness.</p>

<p>Probably the largest field for surface coatings is outdoor wood
finishes. Several attempts have been made to adapt pure alkyd
finishes to this use but with limited success because the hard and non-porous
finish does not permit the escape of moisture contained in
the wood and the pressure developed from vaporization of the moisture
by the sun’s rays tends to lift the coating from the wood surface.
Recently it has been found practicable to incorporate from 15 to 20
percent alkyd resins in conventional types of outdoor paints for wood.
Here the use of alkyds has contributed greater durability and retention
of fresh appearance over a longer period. Paints of this type
are now on the retail market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p id="heading4-3-2"><i>Drying alkyd resins modified with natural materials.</i>—This type
of alkyd resin is modified principally with natural resins, such as
rosin, damar, mastic, shellac, or copal. The use of these natural
resins imparts hardness to the resin but shortens its durability. They
make the product less expensive, permit easier incorporation of the
drying oil, and in some instances increase the water resistance.</p>

<p>Their principal application is to modify nitrocellulose lacquers
and lacquer sealers, in order to impart gloss, hardness, and easy
sanding. It has been said that the commercial production of drying
alkyds modified with natural resins was as important a development
in the surface coating industry as the discovery of the alkyds themselves.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-3"><i>Drying alkyd resins modified with other synthetic resins.</i>—Drying
alkyd resins may be modified with tar-acid formaldehyde resins,
tar-acid furfural resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, petroleum resins,
and the coumarone and indene resins.</p>

<p>Modification with tar-acid resins gives a quicker setting, harder
drying finish with a higher gloss. Alkyd resins so modified are
adapted to both air-drying and baked undercoats and finishes; they
have good durability and adhesion and good resistance to grease,
oils, alcohol and abrasion. For some uses the tar-acid resin modification
gives better qualities than either component possesses alone,
but in light colored finishes it has a tendency to cause the finish to
yellow. Coatings made of drying alkyd resins modified with tar
acid resins are widely used on automobile chassis, fenders, and bodies,
machinery coatings, steel fixtures and toys; they are especially suitable
for primers, undercoats, and finishes on metal.</p>

<p>Modification with urea resins produces baked-finish coatings. As
much as 40 percent of the urea resin is incorporated. It makes possible
coatings with a full range of permanent colors and improves
their hardness and mar-proofness, whereas without the ureas the
combination of color range with hardness had been difficult to obtain.
The urea resin modified alkyds find use on metal surfaces of articles
which must stand rough handling, such as toys, furniture, and
motors.</p>

<p>Modification with petroleum resins produces air-dried finishes.
For industrial use on metal they give coatings with better adhesion,
dispersion of pigments, and resistance to acids, alkalies, and moisture
at a lower cost than is obtained by ester gum or tar-acid resin modification.
The petroleum resin modification minimizes skinning and
improves the luster and the flow.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-4"><i>Drying alkyd resins modified with other synthetic resins and oil
extended.</i>—Excellent water resistance and versatility are the characteristics
of finishes made of alkyd resins modified with other synthetic
resins (usually tar-acid) and oil extended. The incorporation
of drying oils gives a low cost finish with better compatibility and
brushing and with the combined properties of a quick-setting varnish
and an alkyd resin. Although not so durable or quick setting
as the unmodified finishes, they have better water resistance. These
finishes may be brushed or sprayed, air-dried or baked. They have
wide industrial and architectural uses.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-5"><i>Semidrying alkyd resins.</i>—Cottonseed oil is the principal modifier
in semidrying alkyd resins. Alkyd resins of this type are used in
finishes requiring maximum gloss and color retention. When baked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
on metal at high temperatures they show no tendency to wrinkle.
They are used as reinforcing agents to increase flexibility and durability,
and to plasticize other finishes.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-6"><i>Nondrying alkyd resins.</i>—The nondrying or nonoxidizing alkyd
resins are those containing a nondrying oil, such as castor oil or
coconut oil, or the fatty acid of a nondrying oil, such as stearic,
palmitic, or oleic acid. Nondrying oils make the resin less sensitive
to heat hardening and impart greater flexibility. These resins are
used principally as plasticizers in nitrocellulose lacquers. In this
use they have the advantage of better retention of plasticizing efficiency
than other plasticizers, many of which are lost by evaporation,
migration, absorption, or oxidation. These modified nitrocellulose
lacquers, either clear or pigmented, are used for coating wood,
composition board, cloth, paper, rubber, leather, and similar surfaces.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-7"><i>Miscellaneous modified alkyd resins.</i>—This group includes alkyd
resins modified with materials other than those already discussed.
To date (1938) there has been little, if any, commercial production
of such resins. There are many modifiers which have been suggested
and which might be used but for the fact that they are too expensive.
Among these are butyl alcohol and benzoic acid.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-8"><i>Alkyd resins in water dispersion.</i>—Emulsions of alkyd resins in
water are now available for use in clear and pigmented coatings.
These are sold in the form of paste containing 40 to 50 percent solids
and are diluted with water at the time of application. They are
especially suitable for coating porous surfaces, such as brick, concrete,
plaster, stucco, and masonry of all kinds. They are applied by
brushing or spraying and they combine the ease of application of
water paints with the durability, washability, and hardness of oil
paints. They dry quickly, and the dried film cannot again be dissolved
or suspended in water; the coating can therefore be washed
or, after several weeks, scrubbed with cleansers. Compared with oil
paints, they give better coverage, are easier to apply, and cost appreciably
less. Compared with other types of water paints, such as
kalsomine, they give a glossier coating of greater durability and superior
appearance; they seal porous surfaces better; their covering
capacity is greater; and their applied cost is slightly less per square
yard of surface.</p>

<p>Coatings of this type may be applied directly over fresh plaster
without a sizing coat, since they allow the curing of the plaster to
continue. The usual paint pigments may be incorporated.</p>

<p>A special use of the water dispersed alkyds is on asphalt or tar
since they are nonbleeding in the solvents of these materials. This
quality permits their use for traffic and zone markers on streets.</p>

<p id="heading4-3-9"><i>Alkyd resins in molding compositions and other uses.</i>—The alkyd
resins are much less important as binders in molded articles than in
coatings and finishes. Conversion of the resin to the insoluble infusible
form is extremely slow, requiring days as compared with
minutes for the tar-acid and urea resins.</p>

<p>The alkyds are used as binders for flake, powder, and split mica to
produce insulation material of high electrical strength. Other uses
are in the production of linoleums; gaskets; brake linings; laminated
fabric, paper, and cardboard sheets; printing inks; and coated paper,
textiles, and leathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading4-4">Pigments and solvents in alkyd finishes.</h3>

<p>Since the alkyd resins are largely used in surface coatings and
finishes and since this application in this field is producing great
changes in the industry, it is appropriate to consider the effect of their
use on other materials.</p>

<p>The average alkyd resin consists of 50 percent glycerol phthalate
modified with 50 percent oil, fatty acid, natural resin, or synthetic
resin. The alkyd and modifier are dissolved in a solvent, usually a
coal-tar light oil such as toluol, or xylol, or a petroleum solvent, and
pigmented with titanium dioxide or other pigment. Highly basic
pigments such as zinc oxide, carbonate white lead, whiting and aluminum
hydrate (all important pigments in the conventional types
of finishes) are not used in alkyd finishes.</p>

<h3 id="heading4-5">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>Prior to 1929, the domestic production of resins from phthalic
anhydride was confined largely to one maker. The quantities produced
were relatively small. In 1929 there were three producers,
the volume of whose production exceeded one million pounds for
the first time. Beginning with 1933 the Tariff Commission collected
and compiled production and sales statistics for these resins. They
are shown in table <a href="#table7">7</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1933 there were 6 makers of resins from phthalic anhydride,
in 1935 there were 15, and in 1937 there were 35. The 1937 output
of alkyd resins from phthalic anhydride was 58,450,032 pounds net
resin, with sales of 32,583,307 pounds valued at $6,446,011. Producing
plants are well scattered through northern and eastern United States.
In 1936 fewer than one-third of the makers accounted for about 90
percent of the output.</p>

<p>The domestic production of resins from maleic anhydride was reported
for the first time in 1933. The output in that year consisted
of experimental quantities produced by two firms. A small increase
in production occurred in 1934 when another maker began operation.
In 1936 there were eight producers and the output was many times
that of 1934. In 1937 there were 12 makers of these resins with an
output of 2,803,987 pounds and sales of 2,154,988 pounds, valued at
$418,183. It is the opinion of some persons in the industry that
in volume of production and sales the resins from maleic anhydride<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading5">5. UREA RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>One of the most important series of thermosetting resins is the
group made by condensing urea and formaldehyde. As early as
1897 it was discovered that an amorphous condensation product was
obtained from the reaction of urea and formaldehyde. The clear
glass-like mass obtained led to considerable research work toward
the development of a substitute for glass. It was found, however,
that the resin obtained absorbed moisture, resulting in a dimming of
its luster, and that on standing for a time, the condensation continued
producing cracks, fissures, and disfigurements in the molded article.
In 1926 a successful commercial product was developed in England
by the use of thiourea. Cost of production, however, was high. The
addition of thiourea gave the product greater strength and water
resistance than that obtained with urea alone but retarded the rate
of cure. Also the sulphur present attacked steel molds, which necessitated
the use of expensive chromium plated or stainless steel
molds.</p>

<p>About 1929 the first successful straight urea product was perfected
in the United States. It was found that a filler, such as highly
refined alpha cellulose, minimized the stresses. The filler (as much
as 30 to 40 percent is usually incorporated), destroys the transparency
but permits the manufacture of translucent articles in a wide range
of color. Many of the colors possible with the urea resins, particularly
the light shades, cannot at present be obtained in molded
tar-acid resins.</p>

<p>An interesting fact concerning these resins is that they are produced
indirectly from four gases: Ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen,
and carbon monoxide. Ammonia and carbon dioxide react to
form urea, and hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield methyl alcohol
which is converted to formaldehyde.</p>

<h3 id="heading5-1">Description and uses.</h3>

<p>The urea resins are outstanding largely because of their brilliancy
and depth of color, properties not readily obtained in other thermosetting
resins. Being odorless and tasteless and completely resistant
to oils and greases, they are adapted to use in the manufacture of
cosmetic containers. Concentrated acids and alkalies attack the resin.
The electrical properties of the urea resins compare favorably with
those of the tar-acid resins. They have a lower power factor at high-frequencies
than the tar-acid resins, and are replacing, to some extent,
established materials in heavy duty electrical equipment where
“tracking” causes trouble. Molded articles made from urea resins
are resilient but not unbreakable.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The important uses of the urea resins are dictated by their pleasing
color and appearance. In 1935 the largest outlets were in buttons
and buckles, in bottle closures, and in such premium items as biscuit
cutters and cereal bowls distributed by a large food manufacturer.
Tableware, bathroom fixtures, all sorts of containers and closures,
housings for radios, clocks, scales, and other machines for retail
stores, and light-colored wall plates and switches, knobs, handles,
and trim on dash panels of automobiles, and handles and trimming
on gas and electric ranges were among the widespread applications
of the urea resins. In 1938 probably the fastest growing outlet for
urea resins is in lighting equipment. Use in packaging, in closures,
and in housings, is also increasing. Tableware, the principal outlet
for a number of years, is declining markedly.</p>

<p>A comparatively new use is in shades and reflectors, replacing opal
glass. The unpigmented resin is highly translucent and gives high
light transmission and an exceptional degree of light diffusion. These
properties, together with low unit manufacturing costs, reduced
shipping costs, and resistance to breakage make the urea resins an
ideal material for all sorts of shades and reflectors for direct and
indirect lighting fixtures. Many of the shades used in railway
cars are of this material. The resin is available in degrees of denseness
and opacity to give particular ratios of reflection and transmission.
Reflectors as large as 28 inches in diameter are on the market.</p>

<p>Although molded articles are the large outlets for the urea resins,
other applications are of increasing importance. Sirups used to impregnate
paper and cloth are used in laminating and the resulting
materials have unusual decorative possibilities. The surface is hard
and durable and the wide range of colors possible permits very
attractive applications. The urea resins are used both as the principal
binding material for laminated sheets or on the surface
laminae of sheets where tar-acid resins are used as the chief binder.
The latter practice permits a wide color range in decorative materials
without loss of strength or other characteristics of the tar-acid
resins. In 1937 there were seven makers, and their production
of urea resins for laminating accounted for slightly less than 10
percent of the total of all urea resins.</p>

<p>Another application of urea resins which has grown rapidly in the
past 2 years is in combination with alkyd resins in surface coatings.
In 1937 there were three makers, and their output of urea resins for
coatings amounted to more than 10 percent of the total production
of urea. Until recently the use of urea resins in paints and varnishes
was discouraged by their insolubility in organic solvents and
their instability. On the other hand, their lack of color, their high
transparency, their hardness, and their freedom from after-yellowing
were desirable characteristics. The development of methods for
preparing condensates, which overcome the undesirable properties,
has made available resins for this use. They are marketed as water-white
viscous solutions in a mixture of organic solvents and are intended
for use in baking finishes. They cannot be used alone because
the cured resin is extremely hard and brittle and lacks adhesion.
When combined with more elastic film-forming materials such as
drying or nondrying oil alkyd resins, they produce coatings that
are mar-proof, resistant to alcohol, grease, oil, and fruit acids, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
available in a full range of colors. Applications are in metal furniture
finishes, toys, refrigerators, can, and drum coatings.</p>

<p>The value of urea resins as adhesives has been known for many
years and one of the first patents issued for such use was United
States Patent No. 1,355,834 granted in 1920. Commercial development
and application, however, did not take place until the last 2
years. Several brands of urea adhesives are now on the market.
These meet the need for a hot-press adhesive which is applied in
liquid form, cures rapidly at moderate temperatures, and is economical.
For greater economy, the urea adhesive may be mixed with
various proportions of flour (up to 50 percent) without affecting
its water resistance. Diluted thus it comes within the cost range
of animal and vegetable glues and is more durable. At present, it
sells for 18 to 20 cents per pound; mixing it with 50 percent flour
gives an adhesive for plywood, costing about 10 cents per pound. In
1937 three producers made urea resins for this use.</p>

<p>Other uses are in the treatment of textiles to obtain crease-proof
properties and in the impregnation of wood. United States Patent
No. 1,951,994 issued on March 20, 1934, reports the preparation of
artificial silk from urea resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading5-2">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>Commercial production of urea resins in the United States was
reported for the first time in 1929. Early in that year the American
Cyanamid Co. concluded an arrangement with the British Cyanides
Co. of England for the American rights to manufacture and sell
in the United States a resin made from urea, thiourea, and
formaldehyde and marketed as Beetle molding powder. A manufacturing
unit was built at Bound Brook, N. J., and in 1930 the
output was substantial.</p>

<p>In 1931 another producer, the Toledo Synthetic Products Co.,
began manufacture of urea resins. Several years prior to that time
the Toledo Scale Co. started a search for a material light in weight
to replace the heavy porcelain-on-steel used in cases for scales.
The search led to the urea resins and to commercial production by
their subsidiary. In 1935 the Toledo Synthetic Products Company
reached an agreement with the Imperial Chemical Industries of
England for the interchange of technical and commercial information
and of free patent licenses on urea molding and laminating
resins. The name of the domestic firm was later changed to the
Plaskon Co.</p>

<p>In 1932 the Unyte Corporation started commercial production of
urea resins at Grasselli, N. J. This firm was affiliated with the
American I. G. Corporation. Late in 1936 the Plaskon Co. took
over the Unyte Corporation.</p>

<p>The output of urea resins increased markedly in 1936 and 1937.
Statistics for those years cannot be published without disclosing
operations of individual firms. It may be stated, however, that
the increase in both years over the previous year was considerably
greater than for any earlier period. Most of the production was
used in molded articles although appreciable quantities were consumed
in laminated articles, in surface coatings, in the impregnation
of fabric, and in adhesives.</p>

<p>There were 10 domestic makers of these resins in 1937.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Resins obtained from urea and thiourea, if imported, would probably
be classified under paragraph 11 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The
present rate of duty under this classification is 4 cents per pound and
30 percent ad valorem.</p>

<p>There has been no importation of these resins. This is due principally
to the international licensing arrangements which usually include

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading6">6. ACRYLATE RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>A new development of widespread importance in the synthetic resin
industry is the commercial production of the polymers of certain derivatives
of acrylic acid. The commercial exploitation of the acrylates
is another example of the belated realization of the value of substances
known for many years. Acrylic acid has been known for
about a hundred years, and the polymer of methyl acrylate was first
described in 1880. It was not until 1927, however, that a suitable
method for their commercial production was developed. The study of
the many derivatives of acrylic and methacrylic acids leads to the
conclusion that those of greatest practical application in the resin
field are the lower esters, such as methyl and ethyl, polymerized separately
or together.</p>

<p>Colorless transparency, stability against aging, thermoplasticity,
and chemical resistance to many reagents are the general characteristics
of the acrylate resins. In consistency they range from soft,
sticky, semiliquids to hard, tough, thermoplastic solids. Since these
widely varying properties are obtained by control of manufacturing
conditions, rather than by the use of plasticizers, the resins retain
their initial properties indefinitely. Aging and weathering have no
effect as they are stable under exposure to heat, light, and oxidizing
agents. The methacrylates are harder and tougher but less elastic
than the acrylates.</p>

<h3 id="heading6-1">Properties and uses.</h3>

<p>The acrylate resins are marketed in a number of forms, such as
solutions in organic solvents, dispersions in water, solid cast sheets,
rods and tubes, and molding powders. All of these are distinguishable
from many other resins by their colorless transparency, adhesive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
qualities, great elasticity, and chemical resistance. The brilliant
water-white color makes it possible to secure masses having a high
degree of light transmission and great optical clarity.</p>

<p>The earliest commercial use of the acrylate resins was in laminated
safety glass marketed as Plexigum in the United States and as Luglas
and Sigla in Europe. The extensibility and elasticity of the resin film
gives the laminated glass a flexible or yielding type of break when
subjected to a hard impact. Having excellent adhesion to glass there
is no need of an auxiliary cement to bond the resin to the glass, nor
is it necessary to seal the edges since the resin has good resistance to
moisture. The acrylate resin used for this purpose is in the form of
a viscous solution in an organic solvent. A film is applied to each
sheet of glass, the solvent removed by drying, and the sheets are
pressed together.</p>

<p>The harder acrylic resins are used in the form of solid thermoplastics.
Methyl methacrylate is of special interest. As the monomer
is a mobile liquid it can be cast-polymerized to a solid of any desired
shape in predesigned molds or produced in finely divided form for
use as molding powder. The cast resin is marketed in this country as
Crystalite, Plexiglas and Lucite, and in England as Diakon.</p>

<p>The solid acrylate resins are clearer than cast phenolic resins, not
as brittle as the polystyrene resins, and not as tough as cellulose acetate
or nitrocellulose plastics. Their transparency and resistance to
aging and weather permit their use in applications not previously
considered for synthetic resins. Sheets of this resin may be formed
or molded into many useful shapes. The aircraft industry has found
them suitable for windshields and cockpit enclosures to effect streamlining
and thus greatly reduce wind resistance.</p>

<p>Methyl methacrylate is probably the nearest approach to organic
glass thus far developed. Its optical properties make it suitable for
spectacle lenses, camera lenses, magnifying glasses, and protective
goggles. Spectacle lenses are now being made to prescription by
molding. It is estimated that 900 molds will supply the requirements
of about 98 percent of the prescriptions. The excellent light transmitting
quality of methyl methacrylate permits its use in edge lighting,
advertising displays, and instrument dials. It is also used in inspection
windows in various types of machinery where curved sections
are necessary and where glass might be broken.</p>

<p>A synthetic resin combining the properties mentioned, together
with high tensile and impact strength, good dielectric properties,
ultraviolet transmission, and resistance to water, oil, acids, and
alkalies is an important contribution. The acrylates may be colored
or have fillers added to give any desired translucency or opaqueness.
They can be sawed, cut, blanked, turned, drilled, ground, polished,
and sanded much the same as are nitrocellulose plastics.</p>

</div>

<p>A new and interesting application of the acrylate resins is as
molded reflectors in a system of indirect highway lighting. The
reflectors are pressed from colorless, transparent methyl methacrylate
resin and are 1⅝ inches in diameter. They are assembled in a
pressed metal housing to form a double facing marker which is
snap-locked to the top of an angle iron post. The posts are so
located that the reflectors are accurately aligned 3 feet above the pavement
edge. An installation has been made on U. S. Highway No. 16
between Detroit and Lansing, Mich., at a cost of about $340 per mile.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
The motorist provides his own light from his headlights which strikes
the reflectors and is returned as a narrow beam of brilliant illumination.
The chief of the United States Bureau of Public Roads states
that this is a definite contribution to the safety and utility of the
highways at night. The reflector is a group of tiny cube corners,
over 300 in each disk. Each cube corner is a complete retrodirective
optical system; a light ray entering the front surface is reflected from
surface to surface of the cube and after the third reflection is directed
back toward the headlight regardless of the entrance angle. If the
cubes are made with a high degree of dimensional accuracy, the
reflected light has a high candlepower, strong enough to be seen for
a mile.</p>

<p>Other uses for these resins are in sound recording records, dentures,
telephone and radio transmitter diaphragms, novelties, and
lighting fixtures.</p>

<p>The monomer (unpolymerized methyl methacrylate) may be used
to impregnate wood, cloth, wallboard, cork, paper, electrical coils,
tile, or stone, and then polymerized to form the resin. Paper and
cloth so treated have many uses, such as in the electrical and food-packaging
industries. Laminated sheets find wide possibilities for
use in the aircraft field, and for lamp shades. Wood may be impregnated
with as much as 60 percent of the monomer. Solutions
of these resins in organic solvents, such as ethylene dichloride, ethyl
acetate, and toluol, are used in surface coatings, undercoats on difficult
adhesion jobs, to impregnate paper and textiles, and in insulation.
These coating solutions are marketed in the United States under
the trade name Acryloids and in Europe under the trade names,
Borron, Plexigum, and Acronol. They may be brushed, sprayed,
dipped, and baked. Baking is recommended to give a higher gloss,
better adhesion, and a harder film. The dried film has an elasticity
of 1,000 percent at ordinary room temperature and the light transmission
of clear films is intermediate between ordinary window glass
and quartz.</p>

<p>Acrysol is an adhesive consisting of a dispersion of the resin in
water and is recommended for use where adhesion is difficult, as on
rubber or rubberized surfaces.</p>

<h3 id="heading6-2">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>Commercial production of acrylate resins in the United States
was started in 1931 by Rohm and Haas,
Philadelphia, Pa., under United States Patents Nos. 1,388,016
of August 16, 1921, and 1,829,208 of October 27, 1931.</p>

<p>Commercial production of methyl methacrylate resins was started
in 1937 by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. This development is
under United States Patent No. 1,980,483, issued in 1934. The liquid
monomer is produced at Belle, W. Va., and shipped to Arlington,
N. J., where it is polymerized by heat to the solid resin.</p>

<p>The output of acrylate resins was hardly more than experimental
in 1935 but increased somewhat in 1936 and very appreciably in
1937. Although statistics of production are not publishable, it can
be stated that in 1937 the output approached that of other synthetic
resins made in commercial quantities. The properties of these resins
indicate very large commercial production in the near future. Prices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of the several types are still high as compared with other resins
but should eventually be somewhat lower than those of cellulose
acetate and nitrocellulose plastics and slightly higher than those of
cast phenolic resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading6-3">Imports into and exports from the United States.</h3>

<p>There have been no recorded imports of acrylate resins. The two
domestic producers have agreements, licenses, or affiliations with the
principal foreign makers of these products, one in England and one
in Germany. Such arrangements would account for the absence of
imports, except for sample or experimental lots, and might also
limit export markets.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading7">7. COUMARONE AND INDENE RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>Coumarone and indene are present in appreciable quantities in
certain coal-tar fractions, especially in the solvent naphtha fractions
distilling between 160° and 190° C. No attempt is made to isolate
them from the solvent naphtha. Such a procedure would be difficult
and expensive and, since polymerization readily takes place in
dilute solutions, it is more economical to use fractions of solvent
naphtha rich in these substances. The resins obtained are mixtures
of polymerized coumarone and polymerized indene.</p>

<p>The solvent naphtha must be refined by fractional distillation
and the polymerization very carefully controlled. The polymerizing
agent is usually sulphuric acid although metallic salts, such as aluminum
chloride, are sometimes used. The yield and color of the resin
are affected by temperature and amount of acid used. Light colored
resins are the most desirable. After polymerization the acid or
metallic salt is removed, the product washed and neutralized and
finally distilled. Several byproducts, such as naphtha, paracoumarone
soap, and high boiling oils, are also obtained.</p>

<h3 id="heading7-1">Description and uses.</h3>

<p>Coumarone and indene resins are produced and marketed in the
United States under the trade names Cumar and Neville. A number
of grades are available, including the following:</p>

<table class="noborders">
  <tr>
    <th>Designation:</th>
    <th><i>Melting point</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rubber grade, soft</td>
    <td class="tdpg">50°-65° C.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium soft</td>
    <td class="tdpg">65°-85° C.</td>

    <td>Rubber grade, hard</td>
    <td class="tdpg">85°-100° C.</td>

    <td>Medium hard</td>
    <td class="tdpg">100°-135° C.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Varnish grade</td>
    <td class="tdpg">135°-160° C.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In addition to these, certain types are produced for special purposes.</p>

<p>The coumarone and indene resins are used to a large extent in
varnishes for metal and wood. In this application they may be used
to replace all or part of the higher priced natural resins and, to
some extent, ester gum. Their application is somewhat limited by
their rather short durability and elasticity. They are neutral, nonoxidizing
and nonsaponifiable and impart to varnishes greater inertness
and adhesion, fair dielectric strength, and shorter drying time
than many of the natural resins. They cannot be used in nitrocellulose
lacquer since they are not compatible with that plastic.</p>

<p>Another important use of these resins is as an ingredient in mastic
floor tile, in the production of which a thermoplastic binder is used.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Originally, asphalt was used, but demand for light colored tile
necessitated some other binder, the requirements for which were met
by the coumarone and indene resins.</p>

<p>The next largest application of these resins is in rubber compounding,
their effect being to soften the rubber during milling and to
facilitate its handling on rolls. They do not affect the aging qualities
of rubber and are used as a softener for reclaimed as well as for new
rubber.</p>

<p>Coumarone and indene resins are used, to some extent, in linoleum,
for impregnating roofing felt, in electrical and friction tapes, paper
and cloth sizing, printing inks, brake linings, adhesives, artificial
leather, oil cloth, and shoe polishes. As a substitute for chicle as
much as 10 percent may be incorporated in the chewing gum mixture.
Their application in molded articles is very limited because of their
brittleness and low tensile strength.</p>

<h3 id="heading7-2">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>There are three domestic makers of these resins. Statistics of
production and sales cannot be published without disclosing the operations
of individual companies. The output, however, has increased
appreciably in recent years and this type of synthetic resin is now
among the most important produced.</p>

<h3 id="heading7-3">Imports into and exports from the United States.</h3>

<p>There have been no recorded imports of coumarone and indene
resins in recent years. This is understandable because the duty alone
would usually be more than the domestic price.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Official export statistics do not separately record these resins,
although quantities are exported to nearby countries, including
Canada.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading8">8. PETROLEUM RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>Considerable research work has been done on the synthesis of resins
from petroleum. It has long been known that cracked petroleum
distillates, when stored for a time, have a tendency to form gums.
This tendency is so pronounced that inhibitors are added to arrest
such formation. These gums are of little value as resins, but it is
possible to obtain good varnish resins by oxidation or controlled
polymerization of certain distillates of petroleum cracking. By
carefully controlling operations, resins of varied properties are obtained
and several of them have become commercially important.
The unsaturated compounds, largely olefins and diolefins, present in
highly cracked petroleum distillates can be polymerized, with certain
catalysts. The resin produced depends upon the types of unsaturated
hydrocarbons present and upon the conditions of polymerization.</p>

<h3 id="heading8-1">Properties and uses.</h3>

<p>Several types of petroleum resins are on the market, one made
from the “polymer slop” obtained in the high temperature, vapor-phase
cracking operation, and the other prepared primarily for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>production of resin. The former is marketed under the trade name
Petropol and the latter as Santoresin.</p>

<p>The “Petropol” resins are marketed in two grades, No. 1158 and
No. 2138. The specifications for these are as follows:</p>

<table class="borders">

</div>

<p>Petropol No. 1158 is used by core oil makers to replace such vegetable
oils as linseed, tung, and perilla. It is used also as a binder
and waterproofing agent on rock wool insulation, replacing rosin and
mineral oil. For spraying coal to minimize dusting, it has the advantage
over calcium chloride of increasing the B. t. u. content of the
fuel.</p>

<p>Petropol No. 2138 is a surface coating material which dries by
polymerization. A low cost paint is obtained by combining a pigment
and a plasticizer with the resin. Such paint dries in about
one-fourth the time of linseed oil paints, adheres better to metal,
and has greater resistance to water, acids, and alkalies. In varnishes
and enamels it replaces 12 to 15 percent of tar-acid resin, minimizes
skinning, and gives a higher luster and better flow. Another use
of this Petropol is as a binder in brake linings, replacing certain
tar-acid resins.</p>

<p>These two Petropol resins are among the lowest priced synthetics,
selling at present (1938), in tank carlots, for 2 to 5 cents per pound.</p>

<p>The Santoresins are clear, hard, neutral products, melting at
100° C. They are soluble in drying oils, accelerate the gelatination
of tung oil, are nonreactive with pigments, do not yellow on outdoor
exposure, and are resistant to alkalies, acids, alcohol, and water.
Applications are in protective coatings for wood, metal, paper,
leather, cement, plaster, and other materials, in printing inks, plastic
tile, linoleum, and fiber packages. Being odorless and tasteless they
may be used to line food containers. Their high resiliency and purity
recommend their use as a base for chewing gum. Other uses are as
an agent for wetting and dispersing pigments in rubber and in surface
coatings, to replace ester gum or modified tar-acid resins.</p>

<p>At present the Santoresins are offered at 15 cents per pound in lots
of 20,000 pounds or more. Their approximate specifications are:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading9">9. POLYSTYRENE RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The polystyrene resins are thermoplastic products discovered about
100 years ago and are therefore the oldest synthetic resins known.
Their practical application has been greatly retarded by the lack
of inexpensive raw materials of high purity and by the difficulties
experienced in their manufacture.</p>

<p>Ethylene, from petroleum or natural gas, is combined with benzene,
from byproduct coke-oven operations, to form ethyl benzene, which
is cracked to vinyl benzene or styrene. This monomer is polymerized
by heat at 100°-150° C. The resin may be extremely tough or very
brittle, depending on the conditions of polymerization. Products
having different properties are obtained by (<i>a</i>) low temperature polymerization,
(<i>b</i>) high temperature polymerization, and (<i>c</i>) catalytic
polymerization.</p>

<p>The low-temperature polymers, sometimes designated as alpha-metastyrol,
are produced by polymerizations of vinyl benzene at temperatures
under 175° C. A transparent resin, colorless to light yellow,
is produced which is remarkably tough, has excellent tensile
strength, unusually good dielectric properties, and is resistant to
most chemicals.</p>

<p>Polymerization at high temperatures (above 175° C.) yields a
brittle resin designated as beta-metastyrol. This type is transparent
but usually dark in color, has low tensile strength and shock
resistance.</p>

<p>When vinyl benzene is polymerized in the presence of catalysts,
the resulting resin is similar to resins obtained at high temperatures,
except that it is lighter in color. It is sometimes designated as
gamma-metastyrol. Oxidizing agents are usually the catalysts.
Clear, colorless, vitreous resins are obtained by excluding air during
polymerization.</p>

<h3 id="heading9-1">Properties and uses.</h3>

<p>Polystyrene resin is a clear, colorless, highly thermoplastic molding
material with high insulating property, moisture resistance, inertness,
dimensional stability, and impact strength. It can be molded
directly by heat and pressure, and the molded articles are remarkably
resistant to discoloration by light. Polystyrene has a dielectric
constant of 2.6, a power factor of 0.02 percent, and is equivalent to fused
quartz as an electrical insulator of low dielectric loss. Films of 0.002
inch thickness have a dielectric strength of more than 2,000 volts per
mil thickness, which is better than that of any other available synthetic
resin and even better than that of shellac. The tensile strength
of the resin is 5,500 to 7,000 pounds per square inch, and its impact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
resistance remains unchanged at temperatures as low as minus 70° C.
It transmits all wave lengths of light down to 3,000 Angstrom units.</p>

<p>Polystyrene is adapted to large scale production of transparent,
translucent, and opaque moldings in a wide variety of colors. It is
easily molded by injection processes, softening at about 150° F. and
is molded at 300° to 375° F., under 3,000 to 30,000 pounds pressure
per square inch. As much as 40 percent filler may be used without
seriously affecting the tensile strength, although the filler does affect
the dielectric properties. Since the resin is thermoplastic there is no
waste in the molding operation; scrap material may be reground
and used again.</p>

<p>The unusual properties of these polystyrene resins should give them
widespread applications when the cost is low enough to make them
competitive with other materials. Potentially large volume outlets
are in radio frequency insulation; in dentures because of the strength,
low specific gravity, ease of coloring, and absence of odor and taste
of the material; in electrical parts for submarine and aircraft storage
battery cases and separators; and for the manufacture of glass eyes.</p>

<p>Other possible applications of polystyrene resins are in metal
lacquers and in light colored enamels. Their toughness and light
color, together with their solubility in cheap solvents, suggest their
use for these purposes. Such lacquers are said to be quick-drying,
resistant to water, and moderately so to acids and alkalies.</p>

<h3 id="heading9-2">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>For a number of years, the Naugatuck Chemical Division of the
United States Rubber Co. produced small quantities of polystyrene
resins, which were marketed under the trade name Victron when
for general purposes and under the trade name Marvelyn when for
use in dentures. Little progress was made because of high costs and
failure to produce a water-white product. The sales price was between
$1.50 and $2 per pound. Early in 1937 the Naugatuck Chemical
Division transferred its patents on polystyrene resins to the
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation.</p>

<p>The Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., late in 1937 announced
commercial production of clear, colorless polystyrene in several
forms. Styron is the trade name for the resin from this source. In
January 1938, the Bakelite Corporation announced Bakelite Polystyrene.
The plants manufacturing polystyrene have a capacity
in excess of 2,000,000 pounds a year, and the resin is currently
offered at 72 cents per pound.</p>

<p>At least one other domestic firm is doing research on the polystyrenes
and expects to produce commercially in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="heading9-3">Imports into and exports from the United States.</h3>

<p>At least two commercial types of polystyrene resins are produced
abroad. Both are made in Germany and marketed under the trade
names Resoglas and Trolitul. Resoglas is a water-white, transparent
thermoplastic resin softening at about 150° C. Its water
absorption is low, it is nonoxidizing, and does not discolor on
weathering and baking. Appreciable quantities are produced in
Germany and the sales price there was reported to have been 40
cents per pound during 1936.</p>

</div>

<p>With the more advanced development of polystyrol resins in Germany
prior to 1938, evidenced by larger commercial production, by
wider application, by the marketing of a water-white product at a
considerably lower price, it might be expected that imports into
the United States would have been in considerably larger amount
than shown in table <a href="#table9">9</a>. That they were small was probably due to the
high rate of duty which made them expensive as compared with
other synthetic resins in the United States and thus limited their
market to uses in which the others were less satisfactory. Resoglas
was reported to have been selling for 40 cents per pound in Germany.
The imported resin is assessed for duty under the provisions
of paragraph 28 of the Tariff Act of 1930 at 45 percent ad valorem
based on American selling price (as a competitive product) and 7
cents per pound. The American selling price of the resin made in
the United States until late in 1937, as determined by the Bureau of
Customs, Treasury Department, was $1.85 per pound. The duty was
therefore 90 cents per pound. Imports of Trolitul were valued at
75 cents per pound, giving a cost of $1.75 per pound laid down, duty
paid, in domestic markets. With the present American selling price
of 72 cents per pound, the duty would be approximately 36 cents
per pound.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading10">10. VINYL RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>Vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and to a lesser extent vinyl chloroacetate,
are the raw materials (monomers) for the several vinyl
resins commercially produced in the United States, Canada, and
Germany. These are all esters of the hypothetical vinyl alcohol
and are made by the action of acetic and hydrochloric acids on
acetylene.</p>

<p>The spontaneous polymerization of vinyl derivatives has been
known for many years, although its significance and industrial application
have been realized only recently. Vinyl acetate, probably
the most important of the vinyl esters, was discovered in 1912 and
first made in Canada in 1917.</p>

<p>Vinyl resins may be classified into (<i>a</i>) polyvinyl acetate, (<i>b</i>) copolymers
of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride, (<i>c</i>) polyvinyl chloride,
and (<i>d</i>) polyvinyl chloroacetate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading10-1">Description and uses.</h3>

<p id="heading10-1-1"><i>Polyvinyl acetate resins.</i>—The several commercial types of vinyl
acetate resins are marketed under the trade names Vinyloid A, Alvar,
Gelva, Formvar, and Mowilith. The first of these is a product of
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Co., New York, the next three are
products of Shawinigan Chemicals Limited, Shawinigan Falls, Canada,
and the last is made by the Interessen Gemeinschaft Industrie
A. G., Germany. Vinyloid A and Gelva represent the simplest series
of vinyl acetate resins and are made by polymerizing the monomer.
The softening point and viscosity of the polyvinyl acetate resins
increase with higher polymerization. Such resins are colorless, tasteless,
odorless, thermoplastic products. They are soluble in coal-tar
solvents and are compatible with certain alkyd resins, tar-acid resins,
and natural resins. Films of polyvinyl acetate resin are not discolored
by exposure, and after irradiation they become opaque to
ultraviolet light, are hard and tough, and have good adherence and
endurance. Their dielectric strength is good and they do not show
a carbon track after the passage of an electric arc. Various grades
having softening points from 80° to 200° C. are available.</p>

<p>Polyvinyl acetate resins are used in making transparent papers,
paper to metal laminations, glassine papers for food packaging, as
a substitute for chicle in chewing gum, and as a component of paints,
varnishes, and lacquers. They have the desirable properties of compatibility,
durability, resistance to abrasion, and rust inhibition in
the surface-coating use. Having the same refractive index as pyrex
glass, they leave no line of demarcation when used as a cement for
that material. They have been used to stiffen toe-caps in shoes and
articles made from paper pulp suspensions. Gelvas are not molded
as such because of their tendency to cold flow. They are used, however,
as a binder for ground mineral fillers in advertising signs and
for wood flour in molded artificial wood carvings. In nitrocellulose
lacquers they improve the adhesion, luster, and toughness.</p>

<p>Alvars are made by replacing part or all of the acetate groups in
Gelva with acetaldehyde. Their viscosity varies with the degree of
polymerization and their properties vary according to the extent of
replacement of the acetate groups. The Alvar types do not cold
flow when molded, are tougher, harder, and have better adhesion but
are less resistant to weathering than the Gelva types. Other properties
are about the same as those of the Gelvas. Alvars having 70
to 80 percent acetate group replacement are used chiefly in spirit
type varnishes, lacquers, and enamels that must stand exposure to
weather. Another Alvar type is used in injection and press molding.
The high binding power of the resin permits the use of large
percentages of filler without loss of desirable properties. Such moldings
may be machined and polished, and take inserts, such as the
wood core in shoe heels. Flexible phonograph and transcription
records made from the Alvars have gained wide approval. An 85
percent (acetate replacement) type has better impact strength and is
used in toilet articles. Sheets, rods, and tubes of this resin may
be machined in much the same way as nitrocellulose plastic and used
where noninflammability is an asset.</p>

<p>Formvars are made by replacing part or all of the acetate groups
in Gelva with formaldehyde. These resins are colorless, odorless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
tasteless, and thermoplastic. They have higher softening points and
greater tensile and impact strength than the Alvars. They are resistant
to alcohols, coal-tar solvents, fats, oils, or water. Moisture
transmission rate through a film of this resin is about one-tenth that
through regenerated cellulose and one-fourth that through cellulose
acetate.</p>

<p>The grades of the Formvars available are designated by the extent
of replacement of the acetate group. The 75-percent replacement
type has excellent mechanical strength and flexibility and is unaffected
by sunlight. Formvars of 95 percent acetate displacement
have a tensile strength as high as 10,000 pounds per square inch and
offer possibilities in the manufacture of artificial silk and photographic
film.</p>

<p>The vinyl resins have made possible a new type of safety glass
superior to any heretofore marketed. By condensing butylaldehyde
with vinyl acetate, a polymer is obtained which is used as the inner
layer between two sheets of glass. Heat and pressure secure complete
adhesion and yield a sheet with greater resistance to breakage
at low temperatures than the types now in general use.</p>

<p>Although safety glass was invented in 1905, and many substitutes
for the original nitrocellulose inner layer have been proposed, only
two reached commercial importance before the development of
the vinyl resins. These are cellulose acetate and the acrylate resins.
Safety glass used in automobile windshields up to about 1930 discolored
after a year or two of service. This discoloration was due
to the action of the actinic rays of the sun on the nitrocellulose layer.
Since 1930 this difficulty has been largely overcome by using an
actinic ray filter glass (a special glass with a high iron content) in
front of the nitrocellulose sheet, or by using cellulose acetate, which
is not discolored to the same extent by light, as a substitute for nitrocellulose.
Both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, however, have
a tendency to lose toughness and strength at low temperatures, to
absorb moisture, and to separate from the glass around the edge unless
sealed, and to lose their plasticizer and shrink.</p>

<p>Although a vast improvement over ordinary plate glass, laminated
glass made with cellulose nitrate or acetate has the serious defect of
being brittle at low temperatures, such as prevail in the winters of
northern States. It is easily shattered at zero Fahrenheit, while at
60° F. and above it is quite strong. This shortcoming led to the
development of the vinyl resin sheet for safety glass with a remarkable
degree of toughness. At normal temperatures it has rubberlike
toughness which, although decreased at low temperatures, is not
punctured by the impact of a half-pound steel ball falling from a
30-foot height at minus 10° F., whereas nitrocellulose or acetate laminated
glass withstands the impact of a fall from not greater than
one-tenth this height. A further advantage of the vinyl sheet is that
it is water resistant, making the sealing of the edges of the glass unnecessary
and thus reducing costs. Exposure to ultraviolet light in
Florida sunlight for more than 2 years did not discolor it.</p>

<p>The many desirable properties of the vinyl resins, as outlined above,
indicate their widespread use in laminated safety glass when it is
available in sufficient quantities. It is estimated that our annual
output of safety glass interlayer sheets exceeds 17,000,000 pounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of which 25 to 30 percent are for windshields, and 70 to 75 percent
for side and back windows of automobiles.</p>

<p>At least one of the series of Mowiliths made in Germany is polymerized
vinyl acetate. It is recommended as an ingredient of water-white
lacquers. It is compatible with nitrocellulose and is extremely
durable and not disintegrated or discolored on exposure to weather.</p>

<p id="heading10-1-2"><i>Copolymers of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride.</i>—The simultaneous
polymerization of mixtures of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride yields
resins with the desirable properties of the two reactants. The extent
of plasticity is largely controlled by varying the ratio of the vinyl
derivatives. Resins high in vinyl chloride content are better suited
to molding, and those high in vinyl acetate are better lacquer ingredients.
These resins are marketed as Vinylites by the Carbide and
Carbon Chemicals Co., New York. They are thermoplastic, odorless,
tasteless, and practically nonflammable. Their outstanding properties
are resistance to water, soap, acids, alkalies, and alcohol, and
their strength and good dielectric properties. Their stability to light
is improved by the addition of ultraviolet absorbing compounds and
their stability to heat by the addition of lead oleate, calcium stearate,
or other bases. Water absorption and compatibility with other resins
is increased as the chloride content increases.</p>

<p>The principal types of copolymers are:</p>

<p>Vinylite VYN, high molecular weight. This resin is used in
dentures where good fatigue resistance, impact strength, and tensile
strength are required. It contains 85 to 88 percent vinyl chloride.</p>

<p>Vinylite VYN, medium molecular weight. This resin is used in
general molding and extending applications including sheets, rods,
and tubes. Its vinyl chloride content averages 85 to 88 percent.</p>

<p>Vinylite VYN, low molecular weight. This resin is used in moldings,
coated paper, lacquers, floor tile, phonograph records, and felt
impregnation. It contains 85 to 88 percent vinyl chloride.</p>

<p>Vinylite VYC. This resin of low molecular weight is compatible
with nitrocellulose and is used in lacquers and finishes for industrial
applications. Lacquers from the Vinylites are called Vinyloids.</p>

<p>The Vinylites for molding are thermoplastic and shrink very
little, making them applicable to large moldings. They may be
used in extension processes such as tooth-brush preforms, pipe lining,
and wall trim. Fillers and pigments may be added, although pigments
containing iron and zinc have harmful effects on the stability
of the resin. The fillers used are wood flour, mica, talc, and alpha
cellulose. Fillers reduce the mechanical strength of the resin and
lessen its resistance to water. Plasticizers, such as dibutyl phthalate
or tricresyl phosphate, give a softer, more flexible resin. Resins
from the copolymers resemble the cellulose derivatives in their molding
characteristics, mechanical strength, and appearance.</p>

<p>In lacquers the Vinylites offer high resistance to water, oils, and
chemicals. The drying of such lacquers is by evaporation rather
than by oxidation. They are suitable for lining food containers,
coating concrete, coating paper for bottle cap liners, and as a stiffener
for box toes of shoes. Their most successful application at present
is as an inside coating for beer cans. Floor tile containing these
resins mixed with slate flour or other filler has good possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p id="heading10-1-3"><i>Polyvinyl chloride resins.</i>—Vinyl chloride may be polymerized to
give nonflammable resins of varying solubilities. The completely
polymerized resin is practically insoluble at ordinary temperatures
and is used as a rubber substitute. It is marketed as Koroseal by
B. F. Goodrich Rubber Co., Akron, O. Compared with natural
rubber, it has greater resistance to acids, alkalies, oils, and alcohol,
more flexing life, better resistance to sunlight, water, and oxidation.
Solutions of this resin marketed as Korolac are used in special types
of varnishes.</p>

<p id="heading10-1-4"><i>Polyvinyl chloroacetate resins.</i>—These resins known as Mowiliths
are made in Germany. Application is largely for surface coating.
Practically no information on this type is available.</p>

<p id="heading10-1-5"><i>Divinyl acetylene and synthetic rubber.</i>—Two products closely related
to those described above but probably not synthetic resins as
defined for this discussion are divinyl acetylene, a synthetic drying
oil, and Neoprene, a synthetic rubber.</p>

<p>Acetylene, when passed into a solution of copper chloride and
ammonium chloride, combines with itself. When two molecules of
acetylene react monovinyl acetylene is formed, and when three molecules
of acetylene react divinyl acetylene is formed. Monovinyl
acetylene reacts with hydrochloric acid to give chloroprene, which is
polymerized to synthetic rubber or Neoprene.</p>

<p>Divinyl acetylene is a colorless liquid which darkens on exposure to
light and which has an onionlike odor. When polymerized liquids
are formed, then as the reaction progresses viscous products and
finally insoluble, infusible, inert resins. By arresting the reaction
before the gel point is reached, an amber colored heavy liquid,
soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons, is obtained. Since divinyl acetylene
will continue to polymerize at ordinary temperatures, this property
is taken advantage of in using it as a basis for paints, under the name
“synthetic drying oil.” Clear, amber films are obtained from solutions
of this oil in solvent naphtha. Divinyl acetylene is quick drying,
is many times more impervious to moisture than linseed oil, and is
thermosetting. It is not attacked by solvents but is attacked by
strong oxidizing agents, and the gelled material may ignite spontaneously.</p>

<p>Although not classified as a resin, synthetic rubber is discussed
here because of its close chemical relationship to the vinyl resins. It
is made commercially by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Wilmington,
Del., and is marketed as Neoprene. It is sold as a plastic polymer
which is vulcanized and processed much the same as natural
rubber except that sulphur is not essential to vulcanization. Synthetic
rubber is higher in price than natural rubber, but it has certain properties
which make it suitable for service conditions where natural
rubber is unsatisfactory. Among these properties are its resistance
to gasoline, oils, and greases, and to elevated temperatures. It does
not check or crack on exposure to sunlight, nor does it oxidize as
rapidly as natural rubber. Its principal applications are in special
gaskets, printing rolls, jackets for high tension cable, linings for
gasoline or oil hose lines, balloon fabrics, diaphragms for regulators,
and packing for compressors. Its existence acts as a limit to the
increase in the price of natural rubber and assures a supply in
emergencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading10-2">Production in the United States.</h3>

<p>Some of the products described are commercially produced in
the United States; others in Canada or in Germany. Those made
in the United States are usually not made by more than one firm,
so that statistics of production and sales are not publishable. The
vinyl acetate resins have been produced principally in Canada; the
copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate are domestic products.
In 1935 the United States output of all vinyl resins exceeded
1,000,000 pounds, a figure that was increased in 1936 and 1937.</p>

<p>The Canadian output of Gelva and Alvar has reached commercial
quantities; that of Formvar is still confined to experimental plant
lots.</p>

<p>The acceptance of vinyl resin sheets for safety glass will greatly
increase the output in 1938. The basic patent, known as the Morrison-Blaike
patent, United States No. 2,036,092 issued on March 31,
1936, is owned by Shawinigan Chemicals, Ltd., Montreal, Canada,
who have licensed several domestic producers. The monomer (vinyl
acetate) is now produced at Niagara Falls, N. Y., by the Niacet
Chemicals Corp., which is jointly owned by this Canadian firm, Carbide
and Carbon Chemicals Corporation, and E. I. du Pont de Nemours
&amp; Co. It is also produced by du Pont at Belle, W. Va. It is
shipped, in tank cars, to polymerization and sheet-forming plants at
Indian Orchard, Mass., Arlington, N. J., and Charleston, W. Va. The
Indian Orchard plant, known as the Shawinigan Resin Products Co.,
and jointly owned by the Canadian firm and the Fiberloid Corporation,
is now in operation. The plant of the du Pont Company at Arlington,
N. J., began production in May 1938, and that of Carbide
and Carbon Chemicals Corp, at Charleston, W. Va., is in production.
These plants have a combined annual capacity of about 10 million
pounds of vinyl resin sheets. According to present plans this new
safety glass will be available for 1939 model automobiles. The resin
sheet to be used is 0.0015 inch thick as compared with the 0.0025 inch
thickness of the present cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose sheet.
Several trade names have been adopted for the vinyl resin sheets,
among which are Vinylite X, and Butvar. The licenses granted to
domestic makers under the Morrison-Blaike patent also permit them
to make vinyl acetate resins for purposes other than safety-glass
sheets. Considerable progress has been made in adapting these resins
to injection molding operations for the production of tooth-brush
handles, combs, closures, and other parts.</p>

<h3 id="heading10-3">Imports into the United States.</h3>

<p>The official statistics of imports of vinyl resins prior to 1936 are
not satisfactory for purposes of comparison. Imports could be entered
under either paragraph 2 or paragraph 11 and could be included
either with the statistics of imports of vinyl acetate (see table
<a href="#table91">91</a>, page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>) or be thrown into a general group of non-coal-tar synthetic
gums and resins, n. s. p. f., which in addition to vinyl resins
would include the acrylates and ureas. Table <a href="#table10">10</a> gives imports of
synthetic resins under paragraph 11 of the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading11">11. OTHER SYNTHETIC RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The synthetic resins already discussed are those in substantial
commercial production but, by no means, the only ones known or
produced. Several thousand new ones have been reported and the
search continues in laboratories throughout the world. A successful
new product must be one made from inexpensive raw materials
or must possess some property or advantage that will permit its
sale at a price level above that of other resins.</p>

<p>No attempt is here made to list the host of less important resins.
Certain ones of unusual interest or possessing unique properties are
described below. These include resins obtained from adipic acid,
aniline, citric acid, diphenyl, furfural, lignin, sugar, and sulphonamide.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-1">Adipic acid resins.</h3>

<p>The resins from adipic acid are classed as alkyd resins. Those
obtained by the condensation of adipic acid and glycerin are soft and
rubbery and are used to some extent in surface coatings and in
photographic films. In these the resin is formed in three stages as
in other alkyd types: A soluble liquid, a viscous rubbery product,
and a form insoluble in the usual solvents.</p>

<p>Commercial domestic production of these resins was reported for
the first time in 1935 and the output has increased each year since
then.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-2">Aniline resins.</h3>

<p>Resins obtained by condensing aniline and formaldehyde have
been developed in recent years. Much of the research on this type
of resin was done in Switzerland by the Ciba Co., which holds a
number of patents on it. The Swiss product, called Cibanite, has
excellent electrical and mechanical properties. At least one domestic
manufacturer is licensed under the Swiss-owned patents.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-3">Citric acid resins.</h3>

<p>Considerable interest has recently been manifest in synthetic resins
derived from citric acid. The sharp decline in the price of citric acid,
as a result of large scale synthesis from sugar has placed it within the
realm of possibility as a raw material for synthetic resins.</p>

<p>The citric acid resins, classed as alkyd resins, are obtained by
condensing citric acid and glycerin. Commercial production is said
to have started in Europe, but there is no known domestic production
as yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading11-4">Diphenyl resins.</h3>

<p>A series of products known as Aroclors and made by chlorinating
diphenyl are available in commercial quantities.</p>

<p>Diphenyl was commercially produced for the first time by Swann
Research, Inc., at Anniston, Ala., about 1928. The demand for it as
a heat-transfer medium resulted in large scale output. Later it was
found that certain of the chlorinated compounds of diphenyl possess
valuable resin properties.</p>

<p>The Aroclors range from a clear mobile oily liquid to an amber
colored transparent solid. They are thermoplastic, do not polymerize
or oxidize, and are therefore nondrying. They may be dissolved in
varnish oils, such as tung oil and linseed oil, to give varnishes which
are resistant to alkali and water. The diphenyl resins are good adhesives
on metal and glass and give strong joints between such surfaces.
They have a high dielectric constant, resistivity, and a low power
factor. Their chief use is in wire insulation.</p>

<p>The domestic production of chlorinated diphenyls is, at present,
solely by the Monsanto Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-5">Furfural resins.</h3>

<p>Large scale commercial production of furfural, an aldehyde obtained
from oat hulls and other farm waste, has made it available for
synthetic resin manufacture.</p>

<p>Tar-acid furfural resins possess certain outstanding properties,
such as great dimensional accuracy, great reaction speed to the infusible
solid stage, and unusual strength and toughness. They are available
in dark shades only. Printing plates as large as those of metropolitan
daily papers are molded from them as are radio tube bases,
all sorts of electrical parts, and machined parts requiring great dimensional
accuracy. Other uses are in abrasive wheels, varnishes,
and adhesives.</p>

<p>Probably the largest domestic maker of furfural resins is the Durite
Plastics Division of Stokes and Smith Company, Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-6">Resins from sugar.</h3>

<p>Many attempts have been made to utilize sugar as a raw material
for synthetic resins. United States Patent No. 1,949,831, dated March
6, 1934, claims a process for the manufacture of molding compounds
by condensing saccharide with aldehydes and urea. Pure sucrose
yields a clear, colorless, nonresilient resin, while molasses and cane
sugar give dark-colored resins. The trade name Sakaloid is used to
designate certain of these resins; there is, however, no known domestic
production. Sucrolite is the trade name of a brand of resins from
sugar produced in Europe.</p>

<h3 id="heading11-7">Sulphonamide resins.</h3>

<p>The sulphonamide resins were developed from para toluenesulphonamide,
a byproduct obtained in the manufacture of saccharin (synthetic
sweetening agent).</p>

<p>Para toluenesulphonamide, condensed with formaldehyde or other
aldehyde, forms a viscous mass which, on heating, is converted to a
hard colorless resin. Such resins are compatible with cellulose acetate
or nitrocellulose in lacquers, the combination yielding clear, colorless
lacquers of good gloss and adhesion. Other possible uses are as an
adhesive in safety glass, in certain molding compositions, in insulating
materials, and to deluster artificial silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Domestic production of sulphonamide resin is entirely by the Monsanto
Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. It is marketed under the trade
name Santolite.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading12">12. ORGANIZATION OF THE SYNTHETIC RESIN INDUSTRY</h2>

</div>

<p>The discussion of the various synthetic resins on pages <a href="#Page_11">11 to 52</a> carries
in each case, under the heading of production, a notation of the
number of companies producing that particular resin; and the discussion
on pages <a href="#Page_86">86 to 141</a> of important raw materials for these resins
describes briefly the conditions under which these materials are produced.
We shall now consider the interrelationships between industries
producing the several resins, and the relation of the resin industries
to their raw materials and to some of the important resin-consuming
industries.</p>

<p>No description of the organization of a rapidly expanding industry
can be expected to remain accurate for long. But regardless of future
changes that may be expected, the general pattern seems definite
enough to make possible a few broad generalizations. At present
the producers of synthetic resins may be classified in two groups:
those making alkyd and tar-acid resins, and those making all other
synthetic resins.</p>

<p>The alkyd resins and the tar-acid resins are produced in large
volume, and for these resins the patent situation is such that there
is nothing to exclude new producers. The result has been that new
firms have entered the field and there has been a marked tendency
for concerns using these resins on a large scale to produce them. This
general situation may be expected to continue as long as the volume
of consumption of these resins is rising. But when consumption
levels off, it would not be surprising if increased competition for new
business resulted in consolidations of some of the producing units.</p>

<p>Each of the other synthetic resins is produced by a small number
of firms and this may be expected to continue as long as the production
of a particular resin is small, or basic patents dominate the situation.
When and if the situation in these respects changes for some
of the other resins, they will probably develop the same tendencies as
now exist in the production of the tar-acid and alkyd resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading12-1">Horizontal relationships between resin producers.</h3>

<p>Horizontal relationships between companies are those between different
units in the same industry (say two tar-acid resin producers),
or in different industries each operating at the same stage of industrial
production (say a tar-acid resin producer and a producer of
urea resin). As a rule, extensive horizontal relationships are not
common in relatively young industries, and this is true of the production
of synthetic resins. In general, it has not been necessary to
absorb competitors to achieve a greater volume of sales, and efforts
have been directed to exploiting the possibilities of expansion in a
growing market. This necessitated solving technical problems concerning
improvement of the product and its production on an ever
larger scale; legal problems regarding patents (protection of those
owned, and the policy to be adopted toward unadjudicated patents
owned by others); and the marketing problem of convincing prospective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
customers of the worth of a new product. These and other
problems incidental to successful competitive production and sale
of a given type of synthetic resin have been sufficient to restrain the
desire to produce more than one type.</p>

<p>The patent situation of most synthetic resins is extremely complicated.
In the case of tar-acid molding resins the basic Baekeland
patents have expired, but for other synthetic resins either the basic
patent is still in force, or it is difficult to say which is the basic
patent, because of lack of adjudication by the courts. In all cases
dozens of supplementary patents are in force and sometimes hundreds.
As a result the patent situation, though one of the bars
against entering into a new field, frequently forces some relationship
between producing units in the same synthetic resin field. Cast
phenolic resins afford an example of patent-licensing of several corporations
by another with the payment of royalties as compensation.
In a number of other branches of the resin industry, such as the
laminated tar-acid resins and the alkyd resins, the mutual desire of
producers to avoid litigation has apparently resulted in “gentlemen’s
agreements” not to sue.</p>

<h3 id="heading12-2">Vertical relationships of resin producers.</h3>

<p>A vertical relationship is one between producers operating at different
stages of industrial production, such as a firm producing resin
and a firm producing a resin raw material or between the former
and a firm that is a resin consumer. The incentive for a consuming
industry operating on a large scale to make its own resins is naturally
greater than for one using only small quantities. Therefore we may
expect to find instances where a process consuming the resin in quantity
and resin manufacture are both performed by the same company
provided other conditions (such as the patent situation and knowledge
of the art of manufacture) are favorable.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-1"><i>Tar-acid resins for molding.</i>—The present practice of molding resins
is favorable to large-scale production. The shaping of the mold
is expensive, involving skilled labor upon hardened steel; but once
the mold is made it may be used to produce tens or hundreds of
thousands of units. Subsequent labor upon the molded product is
usually limited to the simple task of smoothing the line where the
flash is broken off, since the product comes from the mold in the color
and with the surface and shape desired.</p>

<p>The usual arrangement at the present time is to have a battery of
presses, grouped around central units which supply hydraulic pressure
and steam for heat. A measured amount of molding powder or
a pellet of compressed molding powder is applied to each cavity by
the press operator, who controls by hand the time of application of
heat and pressure and removes the article from the press. The cycle
is a matter of minutes, and since each cycle produces a finished article
if the molding is large, or a number of them if it is small, daily production
per worker is high. The estimated average costs of the different
elements in the process have been apportioned as follows:
the cost of raw material is about one-third the cost of the finished
product; and the combined cost of the mold allocated per unit, the
labor cost per unit, and overhead the remaining two thirds.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>small runs labor cost and particularly allocated mold cost would be
much higher, so that molding is usually uneconomic where only small
quantities of the finished product are desired.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were eight molders that produced their own tar-acid
resins in whole or in part. One of these molders was the third largest
producer of such resins. In the same year six producers of tar-acid
resins for molding, including the first, second, fourth, and fifth
largest, confined their activities to resin making. One producer of
raw materials for tar-acid resins also made the resin on a moderate
scale.</p>

<p>This picture of interstage relationship as it existed in 1937 may be
somewhat modified by new developments in molding presses. There
are now available self-contained presses which are not dependent
upon other units for their supplies of heat and pressure and which
are either semiautomatic or automatic. The semiautomatic press
requires an operator for charging the cavity and removing the molded
product, but once adjusted automatically applies the heat and pressure
and controls the time of the pressing cycle. The automatic
press, adapted as yet only to the simpler moldings, requires no
attention whatever. These presses are more expensive, but may
be set up anywhere and require less skilled labor. There is the possibility
that they may be installed by some industrial users of molded
articles, and thus take some business from the custom molder. If
this occurs, such molders will presumably buy their resin from companies
that are primarily resin makers, since their requirements of the
material would not ordinarily be large enough to justify making their
own.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-2"><i>Tar-acid resins for laminating.</i>—The manufacture of laminated
resin products is most economic when done on a large scale, in which
case the impregnation of the paper or fabric becomes a continuous
process, the material feeding from a roll through resin sirup and
then through drying towers, where time and heat may be controlled.
The impregnated material contains resin in the B-stage. The material
is then cut up and the sheets piled together (the number depending
on the thickness desired) and sent to huge presses which, with
heat and pressure, compact and unite the layers and convert the resin
to the C-stage. If it is desired to produce decorative panels with a
smooth surface, the top sheet used is one colored or printed with a
design (perhaps a photographic reproduction of the surface of a
cabinet wood) and placed between polished chromium-plated metal
sheets before going to the press. Rods and coil forms as well as flat
sheets are commonly made from laminated material. Any of these
forms may undergo subsequent fabrication; rods and coil forms cut
to required length, thin sheets stamped to shape, gear blanks cut to
final form on automatic gear machines, and decorative panels sawed
to shape.</p>

<p>Many laminators purchase all their resin requirements, but a number
of them make part or all of the tar-acid resin they use. In 1937
there were seven laminators who made tar-acid resins (including the
second, third, and fourth largest producers of such resins) and four
producers of tar-acid resins for this use (including the largest) which
did no laminating.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-3"><i>Cast phenolic resins.</i>—The firms producing cast phenolic resins
market them in sheets, rods, and tubes. The castings are made in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
molds of lead or glass, and the range of possible shapes is limited.
The consumers of these products fabricate them into finished form by
cutting, turning, and polishing, much as they might fabricate wood or
soft metal. Since considerable labor is required per unit, fabrication
is not particularly adapted to large-scale production. In 1937 there
were nine producers of cast phenolic resins. One of the smaller
producers was also a fabricator of cast resins, and another a producer
of raw materials used in making the resin.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-4"><i>Tar-acid resins for coatings.</i>—The use of tar-acid resins in surface
coatings has been overshadowed by the more rapid development of
alkyd resins. Nevertheless the volume of tar-acid resins used as raw
materials by varnish and lacquer manufacturers is growing rapidly.
They are used in marine varnishes unmodified by other synthetic
resins, but to a greater extent in combination with other plastics,
especially the alkyds and nitrocellulose. The coating industry includes
many units producing on a large as well as a greater number
producing on a smaller scale. In general, they are not producing
their own tar-acid resins. In 1937 there were 11 producers of tar
acid resins for coatings (including the three largest) who confined
their activities to resin production. In addition there were eight
manufacturers of varnishes and lacquers and one producer of resin
raw materials, who also produced tar-acid resins for use in coatings.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-5"><i>Tar-acid resins for miscellaneous uses.</i>—The chief uses for tar-acid
resins other than for molding, casting, laminating, and in coatings
are as a bonding material, and as an adhesive. These resins form a valuable
bonding agent for asbestos in brake linings and chemical tanks,
for abrasives and for ground cork in special uses. As an adhesive
they are used in making moisture-resistant plywood.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were five producers of tar-acid resins for miscellaneous
uses, including the largest, who confined their activities to
the making of resins and two, including the second largest, who also
made products in which these resins were consumed.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-6"><i>Alkyd resins made from phthalic anhydride.</i>—The rapid increase
in the production of alkyd resins for use in coatings is one of the
most remarkable in the whole resin industry. They go into varnishes,
lacquers, and enamels for spraying, brushing, and dipping. The coatings
may be air-dried, with a wide range of drying time, or dried
by oven baking. The volume of alkyd resins used by the coating industry
has grown so large that a number of coating firms have gone
into the production of alkyds and now make part or all of their own
requirements. In 1937 there were 24 paint, varnish, and lacquer
firms producing alkyd resins. Included in this number were the first
and second largest producers of such resins. Eleven producers of
these resins, including the third and fourth largest, made alkyd
resins for sale only. Each of these groups included one firm which
also made phthalic anhydride.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-7"><i>Alkyd resins made from maleic anhydride.</i>—In 1937 there were
seven producers of alkyd resins from maleic anhydride who produced
for sale only. This group included the two largest producers and also
one firm which produced maleic anhydride. In addition there were
five paint, varnish, and lacquer firms producing part or all of their
needs of resins of this type. The general conditions under which these
resins are consumed are the same as for alkyd resins made from
phthalic anhydride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p id="heading12-2-8"><i>Urea resins for molding.</i>—The conditions under which urea resins
are molded are not greatly different from those already discussed for
tar-acid resins. The molding cycle is somewhat longer and, because
of the light colors used, special precautions must be taken to prevent
discoloration of the molded product by dirt or flecks of molding
powder from other operations, carried through the air or upon the
person of the laborer. In 1937 there were four producers of urea
resins for molding. Three of them, including the two largest, produced
for sale only; the other consumed his own production.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-9"><i>Urea resins for other uses.</i>—Until recently urea resins were thought
of exclusively for molding, but they are now being used for laminating,
for surface coatings, and also as an adhesive. Ordinarily the
ureas are used only in impregnating the outside laminae of a laminated
sheet where they are valuable for the light colors they make
possible. The volume of urea resins used in surface coatings is small
compared with the alkyd or tar-acid resins used for this purpose, but
is increasing. The use of urea resins in adhesives is still new but
promises to become important.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were four producers of the ureas for uses other than
molding, who produced for sale only; and two producers who consumed
their own product.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-10"><i>Coumarone and indene resins.</i>—Coumarone and indene resins are
produced in connection with the production of solvent naphtha.
There were three producers in 1937, all of whom sold their product.
These resins go into varnishes, where they replace natural resins or
ester gum.</p>

<p id="heading12-2-11"><i>Other resins.</i>—In 1937 there were four producers of vinyl resins
in the United States, and two of these also produced their raw materials.
The vinyl resins were used chiefly in surface coatings, molding,
and in safety glass. The polystyrene resins, used chiefly for
molding and laminating, were offered by two producers for the first
time in 1937. Two other producers offered acrylate resins, which
are cast, molded, or used in surface coatings. In the same year
petroleum resins were sold in good volume, their only producer obtaining
them as a byproduct of the oil industry.</p>

<h3 id="heading12-3">Relationship of the resin industry to other industries.</h3>

<p>The term “synthetic resin industry” is a very broad one, referring
in reality to a group of industries producing the varied synthetic
resins—much as the term “steel industry” includes the manufacture
of pig iron, structural steel, tin plate, and wire. But it is interesting
to examine briefly the connection of the synthetic resin industry with
some of the other large industrial groupings.</p>

<p id="heading12-3-1"><i>Relationship to the chemical industry.</i>—Since the processes involved
in the production of the synthetic resins are essentially of a
chemical nature, the whole industry might be legitimately classed as
a branch of the chemical industry. Historically, the synthetic resin
industry in the United States developed outside of the chemical industry
as it was constituted at the time, but with the passage of years
and the development of a greater variety of resins the connections
have multiplied. Chemical companies supply some of the important
raw materials for synthetic resins; their skilled experts possess the
technical training to develop new resin processes; their research programs
from time to time lead to the discovery of valuable facts regarding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
resin; and they possess, or can, more easily than a new company,
obtain the capital necessary to exploit a process.</p>

<p>At present the interest of the large chemical corporations in synthetic
resins ranges from active participation to apparent indifference;
but the growing number of corporations thought of as chemical
which are now engaged in experimental production would seem
to indicate that in time they will be increasingly important in the
production of synthetic resins. Some of the larger chemical companies
that are important producers of synthetic resins in 1938 are:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p id="heading12-3-2"><i>Relationship to the surface coating industry.</i>—The use of tar-acid,
alkyd, urea, and vinyl resins as raw material for the surface coating
industry has already been mentioned, and also the fact that the coating
industry is manufacturing a substantial part of its consumption
of alkyd resins.</p>

<p>At present the synthetic resins go chiefly into varnishes, lacquers,
and enamels for inside use and into finishes for outside use on metal.
Now that coatings incorporating synthetic resins are successfully
adapted to outside finishes on wood, the incentive for the production
of resins by the coating industry will presumably increase because
of the large volume of house paints sold.</p>

<p id="heading12-3-3"><i>Relationship to the electric industry.</i>—The electric industry offered
one of the first large markets for synthetic resin products. Molded
and laminated parts for appliances and fixtures gave good insulation
at ordinary voltages, and frequently allowed a simplification of the
design. This development, coming at a time of rapid expansion in
the manufacture of electric equipment, was a distinct benefit to both
the electrical and synthetic resin industries. The larger electrical
manufacturing firms soon began to do their own molding and laminating
and became important as custom molders. Later the General
Electric Co. and the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co.
manufactured their own tar-acid resins.</p>

<p>Another important outlet for synthetic resins appeared with the
development of the radio industry. Radio now offers a market for
special synthetic resins possessing high dielectric constants at radio
frequencies, and much larger volumes of tar-acid and urea resins are
used in molding the smaller cabinets. As a rule the radio industry
purchases its resin products already molded to order.</p>

<p id="heading12-3-4"><i>The relationship to the auto industry.</i>—The automobile manufacturing
industry and makers of automobile parts together furnish a
substantial market for synthetic resins. In general, the automobile
manufacturers purchase parts made of resin, already fabricated;
parts makers usually purchase the resins they require. The Ford
Motor Co. makes tar-acid resins for its own use. Working parts,
such as timer heads and horn buttons, are usually of molding tar
acid resin; the timing gear usually of laminated tar-acid resin.
For decorative parts, such as dash instrument knobs and radiator
ornaments, urea and cast phenolic resins have been used. Most of
these parts are small, but altogether they have taken a substantial
volume of synthetic resin. Safety glass for automobile windshields
is now being made from vinyl resin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>The future possibilities are difficult to appraise. The automobile
industry is constantly experimenting with new materials and methods,
and its policy of bringing out models annually makes possible
rapid adoption of new developments. Molded window frames have
been tried, and such a use, or use for the complete instrument panel,
would obviously consume synthetic resins in much larger volume.
Even whole motor car bodies of laminated resin have been suggested.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading13">13. THE UNITED STATES TARIFF AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN SYNTHETIC RESINS</h2>

<p>Synthetic resins enter into the foreign trade of the United States
only to a small extent. This becomes apparent if a comparison is

</div>

<p>There are three factors that together largely account for the small
size of our foreign trade in synthetic resins. As a result of the comparative
youth of the resin industry, the complicated patent situation,
and the substantial tariff rates upon imports of resins into the United
States, domestic producers have experienced little competition from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
abroad. The first two of these forces plus the tariff barriers of other
countries have caused them to pay little attention to export markets.
But it should be observed that both of the first two forces will become
less important with the passage of time. When home markets
have been more fully exploited, problems of production have become
less pressing, and most of the basic patents on resins have expired,
international trade in synthetic resins may be expected to increase
from its present low levels. If this occurs, the United States, with
its large scale production for the home market and with its generally
favorable position with regard to the raw materials and the technical
skills necessary, is more likely to become a net exporter than a net
importer of synthetic resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading13-1">Rapid expansion of business in home markets.</h3>

<p>Being young industries and having potentially large home markets
awaiting development, the synthetic resin industries in the United
States naturally began by concentrating first on their numerous production
problems to meet a rapidly expanding domestic demand,
improving their products and devising useful applications.</p>

<p>The tar-acid-formaldehyde resins for molding were the first to
develop. The industry producing them may be said to have started
around 1910, but did not become important until after the World
War, when the drop in price of phenol made the resins available
at lower prices. The alkyd resins and the urea-formaldehyde resins
in the United States began to be important in 1929 and 1930, respectively.
The others may be said to be still in their earliest stages of
development as industries, however much research work may have
been done as to their properties and production.</p>

<h3 id="heading13-2">The effect of patents on international trade.</h3>

<p>A second factor involved in limiting international trade in resins
is that relating to patents. The basic patents on tar-acid resins
have expired; but while they were in force, they prevented imports
into the United States. In the United States a valid patent can be
enforced at law not only against domestic products which infringe
but also against imports. In addition to court action, the provisions
of our tariff law prohibiting unfair competition in the import trade
were invoked to prevent entry of synthetic phenolic (tar-acid) resin,
form C, but when the basic patent for this material expired, the
exclusion order no longer applied to single color material, except in
the matter of certain marking requirements.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The patent situation may militate against exports as well as imports.
Where a company owns foreign patents it may set up a company
to exploit them abroad, or it may license their use by others.
Again, mutual interest may dictate an exchange (by cross-licensing)
of certain patents. International licensing of patents is usually
accompanied by divisions of international markets through formal
or informal understanding. Such agreements may outlive the life of
the patents, especially if bolstered with financial connections. But
unless the original producers continue to dominate their respective
markets, any agreements between them are likely to diminish in importance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>because after the patents expire new competitors would
have a free hand in foreign as well as domestic markets.</p>

<p>The original United States producer of tar-acid resins set up or
licensed companies to manufacture in a number of foreign countries.
The urea-formaldehyde process was developed in Europe and the
first American producer was a licensee of a British corporation. Similar
arrangements exist with regard to most of the other resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading13-3">The United States tariff on resins and resin products.</h3>

<p id="heading13-3-1"><i>Synthetic resins.</i>—Imports of tar-acid, alkyd, coumarone and indene,
styrol, adipic, and aniline resins are dutiable under the provisions
of paragraph 28 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which reads in part:
“synthetic phenolic resin and all resinlike products prepared from
phenol, cresol, phthalic anhydride, coumarone, indene, or from any
other article or material provided for in paragraph 27 [coal-tar intermediates]
or [paragraph] 1651 [coal-tar crudes], all these products
whether in a solid, semisolid, or liquid condition; ... 45 per
centum ad valorem [based on American selling price<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or United States
value<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>] and 7 cents per pound.” Where these resins are produced in
the United States, imports are “competitive” and the dutiable value
is based upon American selling price. If the American selling price
is higher than the foreign value, the effect of this method of valuation
is to increase the duty to which imports are subject. The duty of
45 per cent ad valorem and 7 cents per pound was equivalent to 54
per cent ad valorem on the American selling price of the small imports
of coal-tar resins in 1937. If it could calculated upon
foreign value it would be much higher.</p>

<p>Synthetic resins of non-coal-tar origin, except vinyl resins, are dutiable
under paragraph 11, which reads “synthetic gums and resins not
specially provided for, 4 cents per pound and 30 per centum ad
valorem” on foreign value. This rate was the equivalent of 48 per
cent ad valorem upon the small amount of imports in 1937. The most
important resins included are the urea and acrylate resins.</p>

<p>Between 1930 and 1936 there was some doubt whether vinyl resins
were dutiable under paragraph 11 at the rate quoted or under paragraph
2 which provided for “vinyl alcohol ... homologues
and polymers of all the foregoing; ethers, esters, salts and nitrogenous
compounds of any of the foregoing, whether polymerized or unpolymerized,
... not specially provided for, 6 cents per pound
and 30 per centum ad valorem” on foreign value. But the Canadian
trade agreement, effective January 1, 1936, reduced the rate on vinyl
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>resins under either paragraph 2 or paragraph 11 to 3 cents per pound
and 15 percent ad valorem.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The reduced rate was equivalent to 25
percent ad valorem upon the imports in 1937.</p>

<p>Under these rates, imports of synthetic resins, other than vinyl
resins, have been insignificant.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> After the reduction of duty, imports
of vinyl resins in 1936 amounted to approximately 600,000 pounds,
valued at $145,000 and in 1937 to 650,000 pounds, valued at $200,000.
(See table <a href="#table11">11</a>.)</p>

<p id="heading13-3-2"><i>Articles made of synthetic resins.</i>—Laminated products of which
synthetic resin is the chief binding agent and manufactures of such
products are dutiable under paragraph 1539 (b) at the following
rates: 15 cents per pound and 25 percent on laminated sheets or
plates<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; 50 cents per pound and 40 percent on laminated rods, tubes,
blocks, strips, blanks, or other forms; and 50 cents per pound and
40 percent on manufactures of such laminated products. Paragraph
1539 (b) also provides a duty of 50 cents per pound and 40 percent
on manufactures of any other product of which any synthetic resin
is the chief binding agent. These are, for the most part, molded
synthetic resin articles. Paragraph 1539 (b) does not cover articles
made entirely of synthetic resin (cast synthetic resin articles). Such
articles unless specifically provided for in the law are dutiable under
paragraph 1558 as manufactured articles, not specially provided for,
at 20 percent ad valorem.</p>

<p>A great many articles, which are made in whole or in part of
synthetic resin, are not dutiable under either paragraph 1539 (b) or
paragraph 1558. These are articles which are specifically mentioned
in other paragraphs and subject to the duties provided therein.

<p>In general, the available statistics of imports do not segregate
imports of the specified articles made of synthetic resin from those
of the same articles made of other materials; and the same situation is
true of imports of unspecified articles wholly of synthetic resin
which enter under paragraph 1558. Imports of manufactured articles,
n. s. p. f. in which synthetic resin is the chief binding agent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>under paragraph 1539 have been small. Figures for recent years

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading14">14. SYNTHETIC RESIN PRICES, PROPERTIES, AND USES</h2>

</div>

<h3 id="heading14-1">Synthetic resins as substitutes.</h3>

<p>Any new material will in the course of time be applied to the
uses for which it has special advantages, displacing older materials
which formerly served those purposes. The resulting product may
sometimes be used in the same manner as before, or the properties of
the substitute material may widen the usefulness of the finished
product, or even make possible a product almost wholly new.</p>

<p>Before the development of molded synthetic resins, electrical plugs
and sockets were usually made of porcelain or molded of marble
dust and shellac. In this use substitution has been almost complete.
Wall plates for electric switches and outlets were usually of brass.
Today molded tar-acid or molded urea resins are substituted in part.
In neither of these examples has the substituted material any important
effect upon the use of the product.</p>

<p>An example of a substitute material widening the usefulness of
the product is afforded by a new computing scale, where a molded
urea resin casing (substituted for metal in the older model) has
aided in decreasing the weight and has improved the appearance.
Another example is the use of laminated synthetic resin coil forms
in radio frequency transformers which, because of their better electrical
properties at high frequencies, have aided in the design of
more compact units.</p>

<p>Examples of synthetic resins making possible a wholly new
product are more difficult to find, but the following will serve as
illustrations: Cast acrylate sheets to form curved cockpit enclosures
for airplanes; molded acrylate buttons for reflecting road markers;
and new special coatings, which make possible the use of metal cans
for preserving foods and beverages hitherto impossible to can without
loss of flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading14-2">Motives for substitution.</h3>

<p>One of the most important reasons why a manufacturer may decide
to substitute a synthetic resin for another material is the resulting
economy in the sense of economy in total costs. As a rule, the
synthetic resin will be more expensive pound for pound than the
material for which it is substituted; but frequently the manufacturing
cost is enough lower to more than make good the difference in
material cost, because the resin part will come from the mold almost
in finished form, whereas the part made of wood or metal will require
considerable fabrication. In some cases there may be a saving in
marketing costs. For example, the shades for large office fixture
lights are now made of synthetic resin as well as of opal glass. The
resin shades are less expensive to ship because they are lighter and
require less expensive packing.</p>

<p>Another incentive toward substitution is to give novelty, and hence
sales appeal, to an old product. In many cases the use of synthetic
resins fits in with the present tendency to redesign an old-style
product so that it will be more compact, have more pleasing lines, and
more color.</p>

<p>Still another incentive toward substitution is to give the product
greater usefulness, or lower costs in use. The great expansion in
the use of synthetic resins in surface coatings has come about because,
with these materials, coatings can be developed to fit special
purposes, and dry rapidly, which means an important saving to
those who use them.</p>

<h3 id="heading14-3">Materials displaced by synthetic resins.</h3>

<p>The wide range of uses to which synthetic resins are now applied
implies that the materials displaced are numerous. For example,
cast or wrought iron or steel is displaced in timing gears and in many
small machine parts, such as cradle-type telephones; nonferrous
metals in small machine parts and novelties, such as inexpensive
bracelets; glass in lamp shades and in cosmetic containers; natural
resins in lacquers; plastics, such as cellulose acetate in safety glass or
cellulose nitrate in colored lacquers; other adhesives in bonding plywood;
and cork or metal in bottle closures.</p>

<p>In general, the quantity of material displaced is a very small part
of that material’s total market. Frequently, however, industries producing
the finished product have had to make substantial changes
in their equipment in order to use synthetic resins. This has been
true in the button industry, in the bottle closure industry, in the
varnish and lacquer industry, and in the various electrical supply
industries; and readjustment is now proceeding in the fancy container
industry and in the safety glass industry.</p>

<h3 id="heading14-4">Competition between synthetic resins.</h3>

<p>Any particular synthetic resin must compete for its market with
other synthetic resins, as well as with other materials. The basis
of choice or substitution will be the same as that which has already
been briefly discussed in connection with the displacement of other
materials by resins. As between a number of resins with properties
fitting them for a particular use, the total costs of using each will
be compared and the choice will go to the least expensive; but where
a resin has special advantages in a particular use it may win out
over a less expensive resin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>It should be emphasized that this battle of materials for markets
is a never-ending one. The fact that a specific synthetic resin has
achieved a certain position is no guarantee that it may not lose it
wholly or in part to some newer resin or other material. Thus cast
phenolic resin was for a time the only resin available in light colors
but urea resins became available in pastel shades and more recently
water-clear polystyrene and acrylate resins have come on the market.
Until recently tar-acid resins were without competition in laminating,
but urea resins now are used to some extent for the surface laminae
and the tar-acid resins now face a potential threat in a new product
offered to laminators. If the use of this cellulose sheet, which looks
much like blotting paper and which has lignin incorporated in it to
act as a binder in the press, should materially decrease the cost of
laminated sheets, it will mean serious new competition for the tar-acid
laminating resins.</p>

<p>The general effect of the increase in number of types of synthetic
resin has been to modify the market outlook of the producers of each
type. They are now more inclined to view the market as being
limited by the price at which they can supply their product and by
the physical properties of each resin rather than attempt to exploit
it as a universal resin for all purposes.</p>

<h3 id="heading14-5">Resins classified by cost.</h3>

<p>At present the resins produced in largest volume are the alkyd
resins for use in surface coatings; the tar-acid resins for molding,
laminating, and surface coatings; the urea resins, chiefly for moldings;
and the cast phenolic resins. Roughly, the price per pound of
pure resin material[12] for these various resins may be compared as
follows:</p>

<table class="noborders">
  <tr>
    <th>Type of resin:</th>
    <th><i>Average sales price<br />of net resin, 1937<br />(per pound)</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="in1">Cast phenolic</td>
    <td class="tdpg">$0.41</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="in1">Tar-acid:</td>
    <td class="tdpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="tdpg">.18</td>

    <td class="tdpg">.17</td>

    <td class="tdpg">.20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="in1">Urea</td>
    <td class="tdpg">.45</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Because the cost of the filler is less per pound than the cost
of the resin, the cost of the tar-acid and urea molding powders will
be less than the figures given for the pure resin. On the other
hand, wholesale prices paid by consumers will include transportation
and distribution costs not included in the figures of manufacturers’
sales.</p>

<p>Vinyl resins, acrylate resins, and polystyrene resins are at present
produced in much smaller volume than those just listed. If and
when the volume of production is increased the price may be decreased.
In 1937, the price per pound of pure resin<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was as follows:</p>

<table class="noborders">
  <tr>
    <th>Type of resin:</th>
    <th><i>Average sales price<br />of net resin, 1937<br />(per pound)</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="in1">Vinyl</td>
    <td class="tdpg">$0.69</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="in1">Acrylate</td>
    <td class="tdpg">1.66</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Early in 1938, acrylate resins were being offered for sale at 85
cents per pound for molding powder and $1.25 per pound for the
cast material; polystyrene resins at 72 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Petroleum resins, in 1937, sold for an average of 2 cents per pound
net resin content.<a id="FNanchor_12b" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This low price puts them beyond competition of
the other synthetic resins in the uses in laminating and coating to
which they are adapted.</p>

<h3 id="heading14-6">The physical properties of a resin and its uses.</h3>

<p>A more expensive resin will be used in preference to a cheaper one,
only if the higher cost is more than offset by some physical property,
such as color, which makes it more desirable in a particular use.
The most common molding resin at present is the tar-acid type, but
it is available only in the darker colors and therefore has been at a
disadvantage, where a light color is desired, in competition with cellulose
nitrate (celluloid) and cellulose acetate plastics or with urea
and cast phenolic resins. In recent years the production of cellulose
acetate molding compounds and of urea resins has increased rapidly,
largely under this stimulus. The desire for color also promises well
for the future of the acrylate and polystyrene resins which are
produced in water-clear grades or colored with dyes or pigments.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table17">17</a> lists the properties which affect appearance and gives in
addition to the color range, the clarity, material, the burning rate, the
effect of age and sunlight, the refractive index, and the machining
quality of each synthetic resin.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table18">18</a> lists molding properties of synthetic resins. Of special
interest are the possibilities of using a resin in injection molding.
The thermoplastic resins and plastics (see softening point in table <a href="#table20">20</a>)
are generally preferred to the thermosetting materials for injection
molding because they permit the reuse of material otherwise wasted.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table19">19</a> lists the strength properties of the synthetic resins; table
<a href="#table20">20</a> the heat properties; table <a href="#table21">21</a> the electrical properties; and table <a href="#table22">22</a>
the resistance to acids, alkalies, and solvents. All of these qualities
are important in some uses and each quality may be paramount in
a few. Each material has its limitations and its special advantages
and the consuming industry must choose the one best suited to its purposes.
The tie-up between specific properties and particular uses is
exemplified by vinyl resins, which because of their great elasticity at
low temperatures, are used in safety glass, and by the polystyrene
resins, which because of their electrical properties at high frequencies,
are used in laminated electrical parts. As production of the various
resins increases new uses will probably be found for most of them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading15">15. SYNTHETIC RESINS IN OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>

</div>

<p>Large-scale production of synthetic resins is confined principally
to the United States, Germany, and Great Britain. There is small
production in many other countries, of which the most important are
France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Canada, and Japan.</p>

<p>In 1934 the world output was estimated at 135 million pounds, of
which the United States produced about 44 percent, Germany 26 percent,
and Great Britain 24 percent. In 1937 world output was estimated
at 360 million pounds, the United States’ share of the total
being almost 50 percent, followed by 27 percent for Germany, 20
percent for Great Britain, and the remaining 3 percent scattered.</p>

<p>European estimates indicate that about 40 percent of the output
goes into surface coatings and that 60 percent of the surface-coating
resins are tar-acid and 40 percent alkyds. The Tariff Commission
found that in 1937 50 percent of the United States production of all
synthetic resins went into surface coatings, 27 percent into molded
articles, and the remaining 23 percent into laminating and miscellaneous
uses. Approximately three-fourths of the surface-coating
resins were alkyds and one-fourth tar-acid resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-1">GERMANY</h3>

<h4 id="heading15-1-1">Production.</h4>

<p>In recent years Germany’s production of synthetic resins has increased
rapidly, each succeeding year registering the attainment of a
new record. In 1933 production totaled 17,500,000 pounds and by
1935 had increased to 55,000,000 pounds. A further expansion of
about 30 percent to 70,000,000 pounds in 1936 and present production
trends indicate a gain of about 40 percent more in 1937, to an estimated
total of 100,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Although tar-acid resins comprise the bulk of the German output,
considerable gains are shown for other types, notably injection molding
resins of the polystyrene and vinyl types. The development of
completely automatic injection molding machinery has given an impetus
to these types. While technical progress, including improvement
of molding equipment, has contributed to the expanded production,
the use of synthetic resins in Germany has had a strong stimulus
because they are made almost wholly of domestic materials. Under
the “Four-Year Plan” for the greatest possible national economic
independence, synthetic resins are replacing imported materials, such
as the heavier nonferrous metals, iron, hardwoods, cork, and natural
gums and resins in many uses. This displacement of materials has
also affected such domestic products as glass and porcelain, which
caused the Government to intervene and impose restrictions upon the
use of resins for purposes adequately served by other materials of
German origin.</p>

<p>Germany’s expanding production of synthetic resin has also been
aided by a sharp increase in exports, which have increased well over
100 percent since 1932.</p>

<p id="heading15-1-1-1"><i>Tar-acid resins.</i>—German output of tar-acid resins has been estimated
at 35 million pounds in 1934, at 49 million pounds in 1935,
and at 63 million pounds in 1936. Such resins comprise the bulk of
the German production of molding resins.</p>

<p>There are at least seven producers of tar-acid resins in Germany
and nine producers of molding powders and pellets. Tar-acid resins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
for surface coatings are produced by a number of these concerns.
Among the important makers in Germany are The Bakelite Gesellschaft
(organized in 1910 to operate under the Baekeland patents);
the explosives and munitions firm of Dynamit A.G.; Dr. Kurt Albert
G.m.b.H.; the I.G. Farbenindustrie; Beckacite Kunstharzfabrik
G.m.b.H.; and Rohm &amp; Haas A.G. The Beckacite firm
has associates in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and
Rohm &amp; Haas, an associate in the United States.</p>

<p id="heading15-1-1-2"><i>Alkyd resins.</i>—The manufacture of alkyd resins has developed in
Germany in the past few years. Demand for these resins has been
given a marked impetus by the development of a new standardized
substitute for linseed-oil varnish known as El Varnish, the use of
which is required by the Control Board for Industrial Fats for certain
interior and exterior painting.</p>

<p>There are five makers of resins for paints, varnishes, and lacquers.
The output of alkyd resins has increased sharply since 1934, probably
reaching 10 million pounds in 1936.</p>

<p id="heading15-1-1-3"><i>Urea resins.</i>—The output of urea resins in Germany is relatively
small; two of the more important types are known as Locron and
Pollopas.</p>

<p id="heading15-1-1-4"><i>Polystyrene and vinyl resins.</i>—In 1936 Germany’s production of
thermoplastic resins exceeded 1 million pounds, principally of the
polystyrene and vinyl types. Among the vinyl resins are Acronal
and Mowilith, both of which are manufactured by the I.G. Farbenindustrie.
This combine also produces several types of polystyrene
resins known as Mollit and Metastyrol. Dynamit A.G. produces a
polystyrene resin known as Trolitul.</p>

<h4 id="heading15-1-2">Uses of synthetic resins.</h4>

<p>The original and most important use of synthetic resins in Germany
was for electrical insulation. This use was so extensive that
the industry was organized in 1924 into an association known as non-rubber
insulation materials industry. Materials were standardized
and classified into 14 types, of which 5 were tar-acid resins and 1 was
a urea resin. Every type must meet certain specifications in order
to be recognized by the Reich Testing Institute. More than 100
firms produce insulating materials meeting the institute’s specifications.</p>

<p>Radio panels of the popular sets sponsored by the Government are
made of synthetic resins. Consumption in the automobile industry
is increasing for such parts as instrument panels, electrical equipment,
steering wheels, gear-shift knobs, and numerous others. The latest
airplanes show increased use of synthetic resins, where they contribute
light weight, great strength, and resistance to corrosion.</p>

<p>In cameras and moving-picture equipment, wood and metal have
been in part replaced by synthetic resins. Other applications of
resins in Germany include bearings for rolling mills, goggles and
spectacles (including the lens), and perfume and medicine bottles.</p>

<p>Resins for surface coatings are undergoing rapid development in
Germany, owing to the shortage of linseed oil. Alkyd resins in
coatings are being promoted by the Government, which prohibits or
limits the use of the older oil-type coatings for certain uses so as to
decrease the use of linseed oil and other paint oils that must be imported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and hence require outlays of foreign exchange. Penalties
have been imposed for violating the regulations.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading15-1-3">Organization.</h4>

<p>The synthetic-resin industry in Germany is a unit within the national
industrial organization. It is a subdivision of the industrial
chemical group, called Fachgruppe Kunststoffe, or Group 13 of the 19
trade groups in the chemical division. This subdivision controls
casein and cellulose plastics as well as synthetic resins, and is further
divided as follows: (1) Casein plastics, (2) cast phenolic resins, (3)
molding compositions, (4) resins for lacquers, (5) celluloid and
zellon, (6) transparent sheeting, (7) linoleum, and (8) miscellaneous
(such as vulcanized fiber, bottle caps, and die-casting resins).</p>

<p>There are two cartels distinct from the national organization,
which expressly excludes all functions and activities of cartels. One
cartel represents the firms interested in molding compositions and
the other those interested in synthetic resins for other purposes.
Some of the producers are members of both cartels.</p>

<h4 id="heading15-1-4">Foreign trade.</h4>

<p>Imports of synthetic resins are negligible, although the duty of
4.6 cents per pound (25 marks per 100 kilograms) on imports into
Germany is not prohibitive. Exports have increased practically
every year since 1930, when they were first recorded separately.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-2">GREAT BRITAIN<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h3>

<p>As in most other countries, the history of the synthetic-resin industry
in Great Britain begins with the acquisition of rights by a
British concern to manufacture under the original Bakelite patents.
The Damard Lacquer Co., Ltd. was probably the pioneer maker of
phenolic resins in England. The principal product was a baking
lacquer sold under the trade name Damarda, marketed for and used
principally as a coating to prevent corrosion on brass. The outbreak
of the World War created such an urgent demand for laminated
materials that this firm started production of them for the British
Government. In 1926 this concern was merged with Mouldesite, Ltd.
and Redmanol, Ltd., under the name of Bakelite, Ltd.</p>

<h4 id="heading15-2-1">Production.</h4>

<p>Statistics of production of synthetic resins in Great Britain are
available only for 1934 and 1935. They are given in table <a href="#table25">25</a>.</p>

<p>Capital invested in the British industry is reported as 15,000,000
pounds sterling and direct employment as 20,000 people.</p>

<p id="heading15-2-1-1"><i>Tar-acid resins.</i>—Many large moldings are made in England, such
as large radio cases, desk files, trays, and drain boards. Cast phenolic
resin production has just been started in England.</p>

<p>Among the novelties recently produced in England is a toy railway
molded of tar-acid resin. The trains and track spacers are
of nonconducting resin; the molded rails are made conductive by a
thin covering of metal which is pressed in and secured at the ends.
Two trains may be run on the same set of rails at different speeds, or
one can go forward and another backward, since the two outer rails are
separate conductors, the third rail acting as a common return.</p>

<p>Molded piano parts are being tried in an attempt to solve the
troubles hitherto encountered with wood, owing to variations in
humidity. Resins have long been used in facing the keys, but the
production of piano action parts has presented many technical difficulties.
The secret of success with molded resin parts lies in molding
the joints in position when the main body is molded. There are
88 sections in each piano.</p>

<p id="heading15-2-1-2"><i>Urea resins.</i>—British Cyanides, Ltd., well-known makers of synthetic
resins in England, acquired the Pollopas patents for the manufacture
of urea resins in the United Kingdom, in certain continental
European countries, and in the British Empire except Canada. The
agreement called for a full exchange of patents and other information
with the other licensees of the Pollopas patents. These arrangements
were made for the purpose of consolidating the patent
position and for the pooling of technical data already existing on
manufacture, with the object of improving quality.</p>

<p id="heading15-2-1-3"><i>Acrylate resins.</i>—An outstanding development in Great Britain
has been the production of the thermoplastic resins known as Diakon
and Perspex. These are made from methyl methacrylate and are
developments of the Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. Diakon is
for molding powders and Perspex is in the form of cast sheets, rods,
tubes, and optical forms.</p>

<p>These new commercial resins are considered the best combination
thus far obtained of strength, transparency, and light weight. Applications
in England include fittings for aircraft, transparent inspection
covers for machinery, medical equipment, instrument windows,
lenses and prisms in optical systems, and aircraft windscreens. They
are used in subways for lenses for deflecting and diffusing light and in
battery cases and coil forms.</p>

<p>The general properties of the acrylate resins include transparency
to both visible and ultraviolet light, almost unlimited color range,
resistance to acids and alkalies, and superior electrical properties.</p>

<p id="heading15-2-1-4"><i>Aniline resin.</i>—Panilax is an aniline-formaldehyde condensation
product made in England. It has high electrical and thermal insulating
properties, great mechanical strength, is odorless and odor
repelling, and practically unaffected by water, oil, and alkalies.</p>

<h4 id="heading15-2-2">Organization.</h4>

<p>Most of the British producers of synthetic resins are members of
the British Plastics Federation, Ltd.</p>

<p>Several years ago a 10-year contract was made between the Imperial
Chemical Industries, Ltd. and the Toledo Synthetic Products<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Co. (now Plaskon Co.) of Toledo, Ohio. This agreement provides
for an exchange of all technical and commercial information on
urea-resin products and processes and the granting of free licenses
under present or future patents.</p>

<p>Agreements probably also exist between the British Bakelite Co.
and the American firm on tar-acid resins; between Nobel Chemical
Finishes, Ltd. and E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. on alkyd resins;
between British Thompson Houston Co., Ltd., and the General Electric
Co. on alkyd resins; between Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd.
and du Pont on acrylate resins; and between Beetle Products Co. and
American Cyanamid Co. on urea resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-4">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</h3>

<p>Production of phenolic resins in Czechoslovakia has increased
rapidly in recent years and is ample to supply domestic requirements.
Most of the raw materials are imported from Germany,
Great Britain, and France, but formaldehyde is produced locally in
sufficient quantities.</p>

<p>The principal makers of synthetic resins in Czechoslovakia are:</p>

<p>Resin products are widely used by the electrical industries for wall
plates, plugs, switches, fuse boxes, etc. Other articles made of
synthetic resins are: handles and knobs for furniture and kitchen
equipment, bottle caps, fountain pens and pencils, clock and radio
housings, tableware, cutlery handles, trays, buttons, toilet ware and
toys.</p>

<p>Imports of synthetic resins in 1934 totaled 1,270,500 pounds;
Germany supplied 46 percent and Great Britain 22 percent of this
total. Exports of synthetic resins during the same year amounted
to 166,540 pounds and went principally to Poland, Yugoslavia,
Germany, and Argentina.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-5">ITALY</h3>

<p>The Societa Italiana Resine, an affiliate of the important chemical
firm, Chimiche Forestali, is a leading maker of tar-acid resins in
Italy. A new and modern plant is located at Milan in close proximity
to the electrical and textile industries, both important markets
for resins.</p>

<p>In 1936 the Ministry of Corporations granted Montecatini Societe
Generale per l’Industria Mineraria, Milan, a permit to develop a
factory for alkyd resins; and also Societe Italiana Ebonite and
Sostituti, Milan, one to produce tar-acid resins. In 1937 a permit
was granted to Montecatini S.A. for a plant to manufacture acrylic
acid resins at the Villadossola works of the Soc. Elletrochimica del
Toce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading15-6">JAPAN<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h3>

<p>The history of the synthetic resin industry in Japan goes back to
1913 when Dr. Jokichi Takamine, discoverer of adrenalin and takadiastase,
acquired the right to manufacture and sell tar-acid resin
Products in Japan. The business was financed by the Sankyo Co.,
Ltd., and a factory was built at Shinagawa, near Tokyo. In 1923 a
subsidiary company known as the Japan Bakelite Co., Ltd., was
formed with a paid-in capital of 1,200,000 yen. This firm considers
itself an affiliate of the Bakelite Corporation of the United States
and, according to an existing agreement, cannot export to the United
States. Its territory includes the Japanese Empire and Manchukuo.
China is considered an open market.</p>

<p>The original plant at Shinagawa was partially destroyed by fire
in 1919, and the following year was moved to Mukojima, Tokyo.
The firm makes tar-acid resins, and a full line of products covered
by the patents of the American concern. Included are laminated
sheets, molding compounds, molded articles, surface coating resins,
laminated resin gears and spindles for rayon mills. An interesting
development is the adaption of tar-acid resin lacquers to the production
of Japanese lacquer ware such as bowls, vases, etc.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Japan Bakelite Co., several other
firms have started the production of synthetic resins. The Tokyo
Electric Co., an affiliate of the General Electric Co., makes tar-acid
resins under the trade name Tecolite. Products are used principally
for insulation, although molding compositions and molded articles
such as are used by the electrical trade are commercially produced.</p>

<p>The Matsushita Electrical Works at Osaka are producers of tar-acid
resins and articles made therefrom. The output is used largely
for radio and electrical equipment. The Nissholite Manufacturing
Co., Ltd., with a factory at Yasui-cho, Uzumasa, Kyoto specializes
in decorative laminated material sold under the trade name Nissholite.
The Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer Co. (Nippon Chisso Hirijo
Kabushiki Kaisha) is an important maker of tar-acid resins, marketing
them under the trade names Chissolite, Safeloid, and Minaloid.
The Yokahama Resin Co., a relatively small company, produces
tar-acid resins and markets them in the form of molding
powders. The firms listed account for practically all of the Japanese
production of synthetic resins and for about 50 percent of
the molded articles made from them. The remaining 50 percent
of the output of molded articles is made by a large number of small
firms, the majority being household industries. It is reported that
there are about 2,000 of these so-called plants already engaged in
this relatively new industry.</p>

<h4 id="heading15-6-1">Production.</h4>

<p>The Japanese production of manufactures of tar-acid resin reported
by the Department of Commerce and Industry is shown in
table <a href="#table30">30</a>. These data include the output of plants employing more
than five operators and apparently account for only half of the
total.</p>

<p>Estimates from other sources of Japanese productions of tar-acid
resins indicate an output of 2,600,000 pounds of resin and 3,600,000
pounds of molded resin articles in 1933, and of 4,900,000 pounds of
resin and 7,500,000 pounds of resin articles in 1935.</p>

<p>It was recently announced that the Gosei Chemical Co. will manufacture
vinyl resins in Japan. This firm’s principal interest is in
acetate fiber and rayon manufacture. Later in 1936 the Showa Fertilizer
Co. announced the successful development of a process for
making urea. Urea resins are in commercial production by the
Toyo Gosei Kagaku Kogyo K.K., an affiliate of Chugoku Toyo K.K.</p>

<p>The resin industry in Japan is expected to undergo considerable
development in the near future. Raw materials are available in
sufficient quantities and the art of molding is fairly well developed.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-7">CANADA</h3>

<p>The producers of synthetic resins in Canada are:</p>

<table class="noborders">
  <tr>
    <td>Bakelite Corporation of Canada, Ltd.</td>
    <td>Toronto.</td>

</table>

<p>The Bakelite Corporation of Canada, Ltd., an affiliate of the firm
of the same name in the United States, was formed in 1925. This
plant makes molding materials, laminating materials, and an extensive
line of technical varnishes. Molded parts were made at this
factory until 1932.</p>

<p>Shawinigan Chemicals, Ltd. is the pioneer organic chemical maker
in Canada. A modern plant at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, produces
synthetic acetic acid, acetaldehyde, vinyl acetate, vinyl resins, and
other chemicals. The vinyl resins manufactured by this firm have
already been described (see p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>). Appreciable quantities of these
resins have been exported to the United States in the past but the
construction of a factory (jointly owned by Shawinigan Chemicals,
Ltd., and the Fiberloid Corporation) at Indian Orchard, Mass., for
the manufacture of vinyl resins will probably result in a decrease of
exports from Canada to the United States.</p>

<p>The Canadian General Electric Co. makes alkyd resins for use in
surface coatings. Phthalic anhydride and other raw materials are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
imported from the United States. Canadian Industries, Ltd., produces
alkyd resins at a plant in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

<p>There are about 14 molders of synthetic resins in Canada, of which
all but 3 are in Ontario. These firms make a general line of molded
articles including electrical articles, closures, costume jewelry, and
smokers’ accessories. Appreciable quantities of molded articles are imported
from the United States and smaller quantities from Germany.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-8">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</h3>

<p>The synthetic resin industry in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
is concentrated in two public departments, known as Public
Commissariates: (a) Public Department for Heavy Industry and
(b) Public Department for Light Industry.</p>

<p>The Department for Heavy Industry, known as Soyuzchemplastmass,
controls the following plants:</p>

<p>1. Karbolit-pawod in Ljubatschani, producing tar-acid resin
laminated fabric known as Textolite.</p>

<p>2. Karbolit-stroj in Ljubatschani, making cast phenolic resins.</p>

<p>3. Karbolitni-pawer in Dubrowka, making tar-acid resin molding
compounds. This plant has at least 350 molding presses producing
electrical parts and automotive parts. The number of presses was
to have been increased to 1,000 in 1937.</p>

<p>4. Komsomolskaja prawda in Leningrad manufactures articles, including
phone sets, from cast phenolic resins.</p>

<p>5. Ochtenski Chimkombinat in Ochta. This plant makes nitrocellulose
plastics. No information could be obtained by our Chargé
d’Affaires at Moscow concerning its production of synthetic resins,
although it is believed to be considerable.</p>

<p>The Department for Light Industry has a resin section known as
Mosplastmass producing casein plastics only.</p>

<h3 id="heading15-9">THE NETHERLANDS</h3>

<p>There has been no production of synthetic resins in the Netherlands;
but a plant is under construction (October 1937) at Groningen
for the manufacture of alkyd resins. The manufacture of surface
coating and electrical parts from imported resins is carried on, chiefly
by N. V. Philips’ Gloeilampenfabrieken, Afdeeling Inkoop, Eindhaven,
manufacturers of radios, filament lamps, and electrical appliances.
Efforts are being made to employ resins for other purposes,
such as the bonding of plywood and the manufacture of closures and
novelties, but little has been accomplished thus far. The relatively
high cost of the resins is the principal difficulty. Molding compounds
and laminated sheets, rods, and tubes are imported from Germany,
Great Britain, Austria, and the United States.</p>

<p>The paint, varnish, and lacquer industry in the Netherlands has
been experimenting with synthetic resins for several years. Alkyd
resins of the glycerol phthalate type are being used by Dutch paint
makers, imported principally from Germany and Austria. In spite
of high cost, they have been found to have many advantages, especially
better and more uniform quality. The prices of gums and
resins in the Netherlands during the latter part of 1936 are shown
in table <a href="#table31">31</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading16">16. RAW MATERIALS FOR ALKYD RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The alkyd resins are made chiefly from phthalic anhydride and
glycerin. Phthalic anhydride in turn is made from naphthalene.
Polybasic acids such as maleic, succinic, etc., may also be used with
glycerin to form alkyd resins. Naphthalene, phthalic anhydride,
maleic and other polybasic acids, and glycerin are discussed in the
order named.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading16-1">NAPHTHALENE</h3>

<p>The discovery of naphthalene in coal tar was made simultaneously
by Garden and Brande in 1819, and its composition was determined
by Faraday in 1826 and later by Laurent in 1832. Naphthalene is
almost invariably a constituent of the products obtained when organic
matter is heated to comparatively high temperatures. For
example, it is formed in small quantities when acetylene, alcohol,
acetic acid, benzene, or toluene are heated to high temperatures.
Together with certain aromatic hydrocarbons it is formed in the
cracking of petroleum and in the hydrogenation of petroleum fractions.
Naphthalene is a constituent of the principal varieties of tar
produced from coal in the manufacture of gas and coke under ordinary
conditions, but not of low-temperature tar. It is present in coal
gas although its presence must be kept as low as possible to avoid
blocking service pipes in cold weather. The proportion in gas tar
varies with the kinds of coal used and is greater the higher the temperature
used during carbonization; it usually amounts to 4 to 6
percent but is sometimes as much as 10 percent. In tars obtained
from byproduct coke ovens the proportion of naphthalene and other
aromatic hydrocarbons depends on the type of oven used. Byproduct
coke-oven tar averages 10 to 11 percent naphthalene; blast-furnace
tar contains only very small amounts.</p>

<p>Processes to synthesize naphthalene were described as early as
1873 by Aronheim, in 1876 by Wroden and Znatowicz, and in 1884
by Baeyer and Perkin. English Patent No. 26,061 of 1898 claims
that it may be obtained by heating barium carbide with barium
hydroxide to a high temperature. None of these processes has become
of commercial importance.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-1-1">Recovery of naphthalene.</h4>

<p>Naphthalene is recovered in the distillation of coal tar, in the fraction
boiling at 180° to 250° C., in the creosote oil fraction boiling
at 240° to 270° C. and most abundantly in the carbolate or middle
oil fraction boiling at 200° to 250° C. When these fractions are
allowed to cool most of the naphthalene crystallizes out and is separated
by draining and hot-pressing. This crude material is partially
purified by washing with hot caustic soda solution to remove tar
acids and then with mineral acid to remove basic substances. Refined
naphthalene is obtained by subliming, or preferably by distilling
the crude product.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-1-2">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>The Tariff Act of 1930 defines crude naphthalene as naphthalene
solidifying under 79° C. after the removal of all water present;
and refined naphthalene as that having a solidifying point at or
above 79° C. after the removal of all water present.</p>

<p>Crude grades, melting between 70° and 78.5° C., are found in commerce
as yellow, red, or brown crystalline solids. These grades are
used in the manufacture of phthalic anhydride and other coal-tar
intermediates; in the manufacture of lampblack; to enrich illuminating
gas and sometimes motor fuel; in synthetic tanning materials;
and in certain insecticides. Probably its most important outlets are
as a raw material for phthalic anhydride (see p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>) and refined
naphthalene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>Refined grades, melting above 79° C., are marketed as white, crystalline
lumps or flakes. Their principal uses are in the manufacture
of intermediates, dyes, medicinals, solvents, and textile assistants;
as moth repellants; as a lubricant when mixed with rapeseed oil; to
remove the “bloom” from lubricating oils; as a preservative for rubber
goods and animal skins; and in explosives (trinitro naphthalene).
In 1936 more than 75 coal-tar intermediates made from naphthalene
were commercially produced in the United States. Of the 75 million
pounds of these intermediates produced in that year, 31 million
pounds were phthalic anhydride, an important component of synthetic
resins of the alkyd type.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-1-3">United States production.</h4>

<p>Crude naphthalene is produced in the United States by byproduct
coke-oven operators, gas works that produce their own coal tar, and
also by firms that purchase coal tar and distill it. Statistics of
production by groups are shown in table <a href="#table33">33</a>.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-3-1"><i>Organization of the industry.</i>—There are 10 domestic producers
of crude naphthalene, operating 52 tar-distilling plants in the following
States: Ohio (7), Pennsylvania (6), Illinois and New York
(5 each), Alabama, Minnesota, and New Jersey (3 each), Missouri,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Utah, West Virginia (2 each), and Michigan,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Kentucky, Oregon, Connecticut,
Tennessee, Indiana, Virginia, and Washington (1 each). Although
these plants do not all recover naphthalene as such, they are
equipped to recover a crude mixture of naphthalene and tar acids
for shipment to a central extracting and refining plant. The principal
producing plants are located in Pennsylvania (2), New Jersey
(2), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), and West Virginia (1).</p>

<p>The purchasers of tar produced 77 percent of the total output of
crude naphthalene in 1935 and 58 percent in 1936.</p>

<p>There are 8 producers of refined naphthalene located in the following
States: New Jersey (3), Pennsylvania (2), California, Indiana,
and Ohio (1 each).</p>

<p id="heading16-1-3-2"><i>Trend of production.</i>—Although the United States is the largest
producer of coal tar, the limited demand for the main products of
tar distillation (creosote oil and pitch) has tended to restrict the
amount distilled, thereby reducing the output of naphthalene and
the tar acids to a point where the domestic output was not sufficient
to meet our requirements. As a result, large quantities of these
products have been imported. In 1936 we produced 560 million
gallons of coal tar, containing from 400 million to 500 million
pounds of naphthalene.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In the same year we distilled about 300
million gallons of tar, containing 230 million to 270 million pounds
of naphthalene,<a id="FNanchor_17b" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and our actual recovery of crude naphthalene was
89,536,000 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Early in 1935 the price of crude naphthalene was about 1.5 cents
per pound or 15 cents per gallon, at which level there was little
incentive to isolate it from the various fractions of tar distillation.
Late in 1935 and in 1936 a serious shortage in naphthalene prevailed,
largely because of increased demand by synthetic resin makers but
also because of restrictions on exports from certain European countries.
The price of the crude then advanced in domestic markets
to from 2.5 to 3 cents per pound, with the demand greatly exceeding
the supply. Between 1930 and 1936 the apparent consumption of
crude naphthalene (production plus imports) increased from 59 million
to 129 million pounds, or more than 100 percent. During the
same period production increased from 31 million to 89 million
pounds; and imports increased from 27 million pounds in 1930 to
48 million pounds in 1935 but declined to 40 million pounds in 1936.</p>

<p>Domestic producers of naphthalene are increasing their output,
and they state that continued prices of 2.5 to 3 cents per pound
for naphthalene solidifying at about 75° C. or slightly higher will
stimulate production sufficiently to meet all present and near-future
requirements. Estimates obtained in the summer of 1936 from the
large tar distillers and a petroleum refiner indicate that production
was appreciably greater in 1937 than in 1935. These estimates included
the potential output of two new tar distillation plants under
construction, the topping of large quantities of tar (hitherto used
as fuel without removing any of the products), the recovery of
appreciable quantities of naphthalene by several petroleum refiners,
and increased output by other producers.</p>

<p>Imports of crude naphthalene in 1937 amounted to 52,664,277
pounds valued at $1,133,157, or 2.2 cents per pound.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-1-4">World production.</h4>

<p>The output of naphthalene in the principal producing countries,
in 1933 and 1935, is shown in table <a href="#table35">35</a>. Most of these statistics
were estimated from the output of tar or of other distillation products
given in official reports of the countries or in consular reports.</p>

<p>The figures in table <a href="#table35">35</a> indicate that the output in 1935 was an
increase of about 100 million pounds over 1933 or 41 percent. Notwithstanding
this sharp increase in world production, consumers had
difficulty in obtaining their requirements. It is believed that the
world output in 1937 substantially exceeded that in 1935.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-4-1"><i>Germany.</i>—Germany is the largest producer of naphthalene and
the third largest producer of coal tar. With increased production
of coal tar and intensive efforts to recover the maximum of naphthalene
there has been a larger output of naphthalene in recent years,
but increased consumption has created a scarcity in Germany as in
all other important producing countries. As a result, greatly reduced
quantities are available for export, a situation that is in
marked contrast to earlier periods when superabundant production
created a marketing problem. The manufacture of phthalic anhydride
for alkyd resins is requiring increased quantities of naphthalene.</p>

<p>The demand for alkyd resins has been given a marked impetus
by the development of a new standardized linseed oil varnish substitute
known as El Varnish, the use of which is required by the
Control Board for Industrial Fats in Germany for certain interior
and exterior painting (see p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>). Increased requirements for other
important purposes such as intermediates, dyes, black pigments, and
explosives have also contributed to the scarcity of naphthalene. In
order to conserve domestic supplies, the Reich Government, from
December 1935 until late in 1937 prohibited its export without special
permit. The prospect of continued strong domestic demand apparently
will curtail for an indefinite period the quantities available
for export.</p>

<p>The international scarcity of naphthalene resulted in a sharp increase
in its price in Germany as elsewhere. The export embargo
augmented the domestic German supply, although a shortage still
existed and large consumers found it difficult to secure adequate
amounts. The shortage of foreign exchange greatly curtailed imports
of naphthalene from nearby countries.</p>

<p>The German Government issued a decree requiring that beginning
July 1, 1936, the entire national output of coal tar should be delivered
to plants equipped for the recovery of tar products distilling
up to 240° C. (naphthalene boils at 218° C.). This measure
assured maximum recovery of benzol, toluol, xylol, solvent naphtha,
phenol, cresol, xylenol, other tar acids, and naphthalene. The
decree contemplated an official list of distillation units, and all tar
producers were required to report to the official trade control board
for mineral oil their monthly output, quantities distilled, and quantities
delivered to other distillation plants.</p>

<p>German production, imports, exports, and apparent consumption
of naphthalene are shown in table <a href="#table36">36</a>. Production increased from
108 million pounds in 1928 to 146 million pounds in 1935; imports
decreased from 9 to 4 million pounds; exports decreased from 48 to
22 million pounds; and apparent consumption increased from 69 to
128 million pounds in the same years.</p>

<p>Imports of naphthalene into Germany in past years have been supplied
by nearby countries, notably the Saar (which became an integral
part of Germany in February 1935), Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, the Soviet Union, and others. The United States has been
the most important foreign market for German naphthalene, taking
from 50 to 75 percent of the total quantity exported. Other important
buyers were Belgium, Italy, Japan, and France. Table <a href="#table92">92</a>

by countries in recent years.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-4-2"><i>Great Britain.</i>—The recovery and distillation of coal tar in Great
Britain is highly developed. The annual output of tar, principally
gas-works tar, is somewhat smaller than in the United States, although
the quantities distilled for the recovery of separate components
exceed the quantities distilled in the United States. In 1935
the tar distilled in England and Wales totaled 330 million gallons
and in Scotland, 31 million gallons, or a combined total of 361 million
gallons as compared with about 280 million distilled in this

<p id="heading16-1-4-7"><i>The Netherlands.</i>—Statistics of production are not available.
Exports in recent years, however, have averaged about 10 million
pounds annually. It is believed that the production of crude naphthalene
exceeds 15 million pounds a year.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table95">95</a> (see p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>) shows Netherland imports and exports of
naphthalene by countries in recent years. Imports in 1937 amounted
to 2 million pounds and exports to 15 million pounds.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-4-8"><i>Canada.</i>—Statistics of production are not available. The annual
output of crude naphthalene is estimated at 2 to 3 million pounds.</p>

<p>Imports of refined naphthalene are usually about 1 million pounds
(see table <a href="#table96">96</a>, p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>). Exports are probably small, although in 1929
and 1934 those to the United States alone were over 1 million pounds.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-4-9"><i>The Soviet Union.</i>—Statistics of production of naphthalene in
the Soviet Union are not available. The annual output has been
estimated at 10 million pounds in 1933 and 15 million pounds in
1935. Exports have increased substantially in recent years, those
to the United States from 1 million pounds in 1934 to 6 million
pounds in 1935. Exports to Germany were 361 thousand pounds
in 1933; 1 million pounds in 1934; and 531 thousand pounds in 1935.</p>

<p id="heading16-1-4-10"><i>Japan.</i>—Japanese production of naphthalene has been small compared
with the output of other tar products. The output of crude
naphthalene in 1934 was reported to have been 381 thousand pounds.
Expansion of the byproduct coking industry in Japan and Manchuria
has increased the production of coal tar, byproduct ammonia,
and benzol. Japan has imported large quantities of naphthalene
in recent years, principally from Germany and Belgium. The increased
consumption in Europe may so reduce supplies from these
sources as to cause Japan to increase the recovery at home.</p>

<p>Japanese imports of naphthalene from principal sources, are
shown in table <a href="#table97">97</a> (see p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>). In 1936, 12.6 million pounds were

<p>Under the Tariff Act of 1930, crude naphthalene is on the free
list<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and refined naphthalene is dutiable at 7 cents per pound and
40 percent ad valorem on the basis of American selling price, since it
is competitive with refined naphthalene produced in this country.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Under the trade agreement with Belgium, effective May 1, 1935, the
duty on refined naphthalene was reduced to 20 percent<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> ad valorem
and 3½ cents per pound on imports from that country. Under
the Trade Agreements Act this reduction applies also to imports
from all other countries which do not discriminate against commerce
of the United States. In July 1938 Germany was the only one
not receiving the reduced rate, exports from that country being
subject to the rates specified under the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>

quantities have been received from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the
Soviet Union, hitherto unimportant sources.</p>

<p>Exports are not shown separately; it is doubtful if any naphthalene
is exported. Demand in the United States has exceeded domestic
production.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-1-7">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>The commercial development and widespread application of surface
coatings and finishes made from alkyd resins, in which phthalic
anhydride and glycerin are the principal components, has resulted
in a world-wide shortage of naphthalene, which is a raw material
used in making phthalic anhydride. In recent years about one-half of
domestic requirements of crude naphthalene have been imported (see
table <a href="#table46">46</a>) from Europe, principally Germany and the United Kingdom.
Increased demand for the same purposes, in these countries,
has so reduced the quantities available for export as to create a
serious shortage in the United States. Germany placed an embargo
on exports late in 1935 and continued it until late in 1937.</p>

<p>Vast quantities of naphthalene potentially available in this country
were not recovered because of the low prices prevailing
until 1936. Since then an increase in the price of crude naphthalene
from 1.55 cents to 2.5 cents and 3 cents per pound has stimulated
production and has led to additional recovery.</p>

<h3 id="heading16-2">PHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE</h3>

<h4 id="heading16-2-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>Phthalic anhydride is an aromatic polybasic organic acid anhydride
made from naphthalene by vapor phase catalytic oxidation.
It is marketed as white needle-shaped crystals or flakes having a
melting point of 130° to 131° C. and boiling at 284° to 285° C. It
is the cheapest and most widely used aromatic organic acid. Its
most important use is in the manufacture of synthetic resins of the
alkyd type. Other important uses are in dye intermediates; in
phenolphthalein; in benzoic acid; in dyes such as indigo, phloxines,
rhodamines, erythrosines; and in esters such as dibutyl phthalate
(widely used as a plasticizer in nitrocellulose lacquers and films and
of interest as a greaseless lubricant), diethyl phthalate (used as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
perfume fixative and denaturant of alcohol), dimethyl phthalate
(used as a plasticizer in cellulose acetate films), and diamyl phthalate
(used as a plasticizer). Important new processes using phthalic
anhydride as a raw material include the syntheses of anthraquinone,
substituted anthraquinones, and benzoyl benzoic acid.</p>

<p>Before the World War phthalic anhydride was made by heating
naphthalene with sulphuric acid in the presence of mercury; the
sulphuric acid acted as an oxidizer, and sulphur dioxide and carbon
dioxide were liberated. This process was used in Europe and in
the United States to produce the small quantities of phthalic anhydride
needed for the manufacture of certain dyes and intermediates.
It proved highly unsatisfactory as to operation; the yield varying
widely from batch to batch. The sales price of the phthalic anhydride
produced at that time was as high as $4.25 per pound,
whereas it is 12 to 14 cents per pound today.</p>

<p>In September 1916, Gibbs and Conover, working in the Color
Laboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, United States
Department of Agriculture, developed a process for the synthesis of
phthalic anhydride by the direct vapor phase catalytic oxidation of
naphthalene. This work was done under the United States Government’s
wartime investigation of the manufacture of intermediates
and dyes. Gibbs and Conover were granted United States Patent
No. 1,285,117 covering the basic process, and the invention was assigned
to the people of the United States. This process revolutionized
the manufacture of phthalic anhydride, causing the market
price to drop to $2.85 per pound in 1918, to 46 cents per pound in
1920, and to 13 cents in 1930. With each decline in price new outlets
were found, and domestic production increased practically every
year, rising from 227,000 pounds in 1918 to 23,500,000 pounds in
1935.</p>

<p>By a remarkable coincidence the same basic process was developed
in Germany, by Alfred Wohl, in the laboratories of the Interessen
Gemeinschaft Industrie A. G. (German I. G.), at almost the same
time that Gibbs and Conover made their discovery. In 1920 Wohl
applied for a United States patent covering this process, claiming
invention in the summer of 1916. There was some doubt
whether his discovery had been made 2 months earlier or 3 days
later than that of Gibbs and Conover, but in July 1934 the United
States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals rendered a decision
in favor of the German inventor, allowing Wohl’s claim filed with
the German patent office on June 28, 1916. Therefore, Wohl’s claim
covering the air oxidization process was upheld and he was granted
United States Patent No. 1,971,888, issued August 28, 1934 and assigned
to the German I. G.</p>

<p>Several domestic firms began commercial production of phthalic
anhydride about 1918 under the patent of Gibbs and Conover and
have since operated the process continuously. Such manufacturers
are presumably protected from possible patent litigation and the
payment of royalties under the Wohl patent by section 3 of the so-called
Nolan Act of 1921, which states: “No patent granted or
validated ... shall affect the right of any citizen of the
United States or his successor in business to continue the manufacture,
use, or sale commenced before the passage of this Act, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
shall the continued manufacture, use, or sale by such citizen ...
constitute an infringement.”</p>

<p>Source: Compiled from annual reports of the Tariff Commission on dyes and other synthetic organic
chemicals in the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>There are six domestic makers of phthalic anhydride, with producing
units at Bridgeville, Pa., Buffalo, N. Y., Philadelphia, Pa.,
Deepwater Point, N. J., Saint Louis, Mo., and Detroit, Mich. Five
of these firms have been producing in commercial quantities continuously
for a number of years and it is therefore believed that
these companies may continue to produce without the payment of
royalties. New producers using this process, however, might be at a
disadvantage unless licensed to operate without the payment of
royalties by the owner of the patent.</p>

<p>The production of phthalic anhydride has increased remarkably
since the discovery of the vapor phase catalytic process of manufacture.
Until 1922 the only large outlet was the coal-tar dye industry.
The development of new uses for phthalic esters, principally dibutyl
phthalate, increased the demand during the period 1922-28. With
the drop in price of phthalic anhydride, resins made from it and
glycerin became of commercial interest and about 1929 their production
began to increase sharply. Most of the increased output since
that year is accounted for by its use in alkyd resins. As previously
stated, surface coatings made from these resins are now applied to
practically all “indoor” surfaces, both wood and metal, and to “outdoor”
use on metal. Largely as a result of the growing popularity
of surface coatings of the alkyd type the domestic production of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
phthalic anhydride exceeded 45 million pounds in 1937 and may
reach 50 million pounds in 1938. This estimate is based on the
present trend of consumption of alkyd resins and current use therein
of phthalic anhydride. Should other polybasic acids be used in
greater proportion the estimate would have to be revised. Considerable
research work is being done on certain polybasic acids, with
very promising results in some instances. Maleic anhydride is being
used commercially, as are adipic acid, malic acid, and succinic acid.
Other possibilities include such acids as citric, tartaric, sebacic, fumaric,
and oxalic.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-2-3">Production in other countries.</h4>

<p>Phthalic anhydride is manufactured in Germany, England, France,
Italy, and Japan, but no statistics of foreign production or of international
trade are available. The output in Germany is known to
be increasing rapidly and is believed to be the principal reason for
the German embargo on exports of naphthalene.</p>

<p>In England there are two makers: Imperial Chemical Industries,
Ltd., and Monsanto Chemicals, Ltd. The latter is a branch of the
American firm of the same name.</p>

<p>In Italy, production was started in 1928 by the A. C. N. A. at
Cengio. Capacity is given as 600,000 pounds annually, and the
process is essentially the same as in this country.</p>

<p>Japanese production is estimated at 6 million pounds a year.
Nihon Seuryo’s plant is the principal one, and the Nishijima mill,
at Osaka, the next in importance.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-2-4">United States foreign trade.</h4>

<p>Imports of phthalic anhydride are dutiable under paragraph 27
at 7 cents per pound and 40 percent ad valorem based on American
selling price. There were practically no imports since the World
War until 1937, when 223,431 pounds were imported from England
to relieve a temporary shortage.</p>

<p>Exports, if any, are not shown separately in official statistics.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-2-5">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>Phthalic anhydride is the cheapest polybasic organic acid and
therefore the most widely used in the production of alkyd resins.
The rapid rise in consumption of surface coatings and finishes made
from these resins presages greater demand for phthalic anhydride
(and glycerin) in the future, particularly if this type of outdoor
finish for wood is successful.</p>

<p>The world-wide shortage of naphthalene, with attendant sharp
increases in price, raises the question of whether there may not be
partial or complete replacement of phthalic anhydride by other
polybasic acids in certain types of alkyd resins. The probability of
such replacement seems remote unless the use of other polybasic acids,
at present much higher priced, so improves the properties of the
resins as to give a superior product. Approximately 100 pounds
of naphthalene are required to produce 109 pounds of phthalic anhydride.
Naphthalene at 3 cents per pound gives phthalic anhydride
a raw material cost of 2.75 cents per pound as compared with 1.45
cents per pound when naphthalene was 1.55 cents per pound. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
other words, the increase of 1.5 cents per pound in naphthalene,
meant an increase of only about 1⅓ cents per pound in the raw
material cost of phthalic anhydride, and only approximately ¼ cent
per pound in the raw material cost of an alkyd resin surface coating
containing about 20-percent phthalic anhydride.</p>

<h3 id="heading16-3">POLYBASIC ACIDS OTHER THAN PHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE</h3>

<h4 id="heading16-3-1">Maleic acid and anhydride.</h4>

<p>Maleic anhydride is obtained as a byproduct in the manufacture of
phthalic anhydride and as a major product by the vapor phase
catalytic oxidation of benzene. Domestic production, still small compared
with phthalic anhydride, has increased many fold during the
past two or three years. In 1937 there were three producers of
maleic anhydride, with an output totaling 2,114,176 pounds. The
uses of maleic acid derivatives other than in making resins are
minor.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-3-2">Malic acid and malomalic acid.</h4>

<p>Malic acid is widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom, occurring
especially in unripe apples. Commercially it is obtained by synthesis.
Domestic production was reported for the first time in 1935.
Malomalic acid is formed by heating malic acid. United States
Patent No. 1,091,627 covers a resin made from malic acid and glycerin
which will increase the toughness of phthalate resins. United States
Patent No. 1,667,198 suggests the use of malomalic acid to form resins
of glass-like appearance.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-3-3">Adipic acid.</h4>

<p>Adipic acid is made by oxidation of cyclohexanol. When condensed
with glycerin it yields an alkyd resin which is soft and
rubbery and which does not harden when heated. Numerous patents
have been granted on the preparation of adipic acid and its resins.
Commercial production of adipic acid was first reported in 1935,
and the output increased in 1936 and in 1937.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-3-4">Succinic acid and anhydride.</h4>

<p>Succinic acid is a white crystalline powder melting at 185° C.
and boiling at 234° C., with decomposition to succinic anhydride. It
may be obtained by the reduction of maleic acid. Condensation with
glycerin gives a resin tougher and more flexible than is obtained with
phthalic anhydride.</p>

<p>In 1937 there were two commercial producers of succinic acid. It
is believed that small quantities are used in combination with phthalic
anhydride in alkyd resins.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-3-5">Fumaric acid.</h4>

<p>Fumaric acid is a white crystalline powder obtained by the prolonged
heating of or by the action of mineral acids on maleic acid.
Fumaric acid and maleic acid are structurally identical and the
former decomposes at about 280° C., forming the latter. In 1937 there
was one domestic maker of fumaric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<h3 id="heading16-4">GLYCERIN</h3>

<h4 id="heading16-4-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>Glycerin (glycerol) is a clear, colorless or almost colorless, odorless,
syrupy, hygroscopic liquid. It is obtained as a byproduct of the
soap and fatty acid (oleic acid or red oil and stearic acid) industries.
Other sources are insignificant; glycerin can be produced by the
fermentation of carbohydrates such as molasses, but when glycerin
prices are low this process is not profitable. The chief commercial
grades of crude glycerin are “soap lye” glycerin, a byproduct of the
soap industry, containing about 80 percent glycerin, and “saponification”
grade, a byproduct of the fatty acid industry, containing about
88 percent glycerin. Chemically pure grades contain about 95 percent
and dynamite grades about 98.5 percent glycerin. Other grades
include “30° yellow distilled” containing about 96 percent glycerin.</p>

<p>The uses of glycerin are extremely varied, the most important
being in the manufacture of alkyd resins and ester gums; in the
manufacture of nitroglycerin and dynamite; as a moistening, antiseptic,
and sweetening agent in tobacco; in pharmaceutical and medicinal
preparations; and in certain soft drinks, soaps, and inks.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-4-2">United States production.</h4>

<p>The output of both the crude and the refined has increased in
recent years, reaching new highs in 1937. Chemically pure glycerin
constitutes about 60 percent of the total refined output and dynamite
and other grades about 40 percent. In the production statistics
shown in table <a href="#table48">48</a>, grades such as yellow distilled are included with
the dynamite grade. Since large soap makers refine their own crude
glycerin, the sale of crude is only a small part of the total output.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table48">48</a> shows domestic production of glycerin by grades and table
<a href="#table49">49</a> production for sale.</p>

</div>

<p>Crude glycerin is produced by about 200 soap makers and by about
12 producers of fatty acids. Soap factories are located in more than
half the States, the principal ones being in Ohio, New York, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania; the
fatty acid plants are located in five or six States, Ohio being of chief
importance. Most of the smaller producers sell their output of crude
glycerin. Refiners of glycerin are few in number compared to the
producers of crude. The larger soap plants refine their own crude
glycerin and in addition purchase crude from other plants for refining.</p>

<p>The process of recovering glycerin consists of chemically treating
weak glycerin solutions separated from the soap or fatty acids, and
then concentrating and distilling under reduced pressures. The
average yield is less than 10 percent but varies from about 9 to 12
percent, depending upon the kinds of oils and fats used. When
prices are high every effort is made to recover the maximum yield of
glycerin; when prices are low, cost of chemical treatment and distillation
makes it advisable to allow more glycerin to remain in the
soap or to discard the weak solutions.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-4-3">Production in other countries.</h4>

<p>As in the United States, glycerin is produced in foreign countries,
as a byproduct of the soap and fatty acid industries. The United
Kingdom, Germany, and France, and recently the Soviet Union, are
the leading producers. The output in each of these countries is estimated
to be less than a third of the output in the United States.
The British Census of 1930 reports the production of crude glycerin
in the United Kingdom at 44 million pounds. Authentic statistics
on production in other leading countries are not available, but most
estimates show lower figures than for the United Kingdom. In some
European countries the normal production of soap results in more
glycerin than can be utilized.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-4-4">International trade.</h4>

<p>France is the principal net exporter of crude glycerin and the
United Kingdom of refined glycerin. The Netherlands, Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
and France are also net exporters of refined glycerin. The international
trade of certain of the more important producing countries in
crude and refined glycerin is shown in table <a href="#table50">50</a>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Imports from Cuba and the Philippines not included in the United States statistics. These imports,

<h4 id="heading16-4-5">United States imports.</h4>

<p>Under the Tariff Act of 1922, paragraph 43, imports of crude glycerin
were dutiable at 1 cent per pound and refined glycerin at 2
cents per pound. The Tariff Act of 1930, paragraph 42, carries the
same rates. Imports of crude glycerin from Cuba enjoy a preferential
rate; they were dutiable at 0.8 cent per pound up to September 3,
1934, and at 0.4 cent per pound thereafter. Under the trade agreement
with the Netherlands, effective February 1, 1936, the rate on
refined glycerin was reduced from 2 cents to 1⅔ cents per pound
(⅔ cent plus regular rate on crude, but not more than 1⅔ cents).
Under the trade agreement with France, effective June 15, 1936, the
rate on crude glycerin was reduced from 1 cent to 0.8 cent, which
automatically further reduced the rate on refined glycerin to 1¹⁴⁄₃₀
(approximately 1.47) cents per pound. The rates under these last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
two trade agreements are generalized to all countries which do not
discriminate against our commerce.</p>

<p>The amount of glycerin supplied by imports has greatly declined.
Prior to the World War, imports of crude glycerin ranged from 30
million to 40 million pounds annually. After the war imports were
less and after 1929 declined to comparatively small quantities, except
in 1934. Imports of refined glycerin were relatively unimportant
until 1924, except in 1920. They amounted to almost 11 million
pounds in 1926, but declined thereafter. Some of the imports are
reexported with benefit of drawback. In 1930, 1,006,164 pounds of
imported crude glycerin and 396,792 pounds of imported refined were
thus reexported, chiefly in the refined grades. Corresponding figures
in 1932 and 1933 were 197,331 and 111,753 pounds of crude, and 40,011
and 10,056 pounds of refined.</p>

<p>France has usually been the principal source of imports of crude
glycerin, but since 1935 Cuba has ranked first. Cuban imports enter
at a preferential rate of duty (0.8 cent per pound on crude until
September 3, 1934, when it was reduced to 0.4 cent). Receipts from
the Philippines are duty-free. Imports by countries for recent years
are given in table <a href="#table98">98</a>, page <a href="#Page_151">151</a>.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has generally been the chief source of imports of
refined glycerin, although the United Kingdom was first in 1934 and
1935 and France first in 1937. Imports by countries for recent years
are given in table <a href="#table99">99</a>, page <a href="#Page_152">152</a>.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-4-6">United States exports.</h4>

<p>Exports of glycerin are insignificant compared with production
and are small compared with imports. They go chiefly to Mexico
and Canada, and, at times, also to Cuba, the Philippines, and Chile.
Geographic propinquity is probably the principal factor accounting
for these exports, although it is possible that some exports are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
destined to foreign branch factories of an American company for
making dynamite.</p>

<p>Crude and refined grades were not separately distinguished in
export statistics, but it is known that exports consist principally,
if not entirely, of the refined. In 1933 and 1934 glycerin exports
were not reported. Statistics of exports are given in table <a href="#table54">54</a>.</p>

<h4 id="heading16-4-7">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>Glycerin occurs in chemical combination in animal and vegetable
oils and fats. Since it is obtained as a byproduct, the output is
dependent primarily upon the output of the major products, soaps
and fatty acids, and its production is largely independent of demand.
At low prices, however, less glycerin is recovered.</p>

<p>The United States usually consumes more glycerin than it produces
(see table <a href="#table55">55</a>), whereas leading European producing nations
produce more than they consume. In recent years the domestic
production has apparently been approaching domestic requirements.
A factor tending to decrease demand is the increasing resort to substitutes
in various uses, particularly ethylene glycol, ethyl alcohol,
and methyl alcohol. On the other hand, the demand in the resin
industry is expanding rapidly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading17">17. RAW MATERIALS FOR TAR-ACID RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The first tar-acid resins were made from phenol and formaldehyde.
As a result this group of resins is frequently spoken of as
phenolic resins. This is true despite the fact that coal-tar acids other
than phenol, particularly the cresols and xylenols, are used in large
volume today.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-1">THE TAR ACIDS</h3>

<p>The term coal-tar acids is applied to certain organic compounds
either obtained from or known to be present in coal tar. Probably the
best known is phenol or carbolic acid, produced in large quantities
in the United States and abroad. Others of commercial importance
are ortho, meta, and para cresol and the xylenols. All of these are
definite chemical compounds available as such or in mixture with
other tar acids. Cresylic acid is a term widely used in commerce for
almost any mixture of tar acids. Formerly it was used to designate
a mixture of ortho, meta, and para cresols in the proportions in
which they are found in coal tar. The higher boiling tar acids
(listed in table <a href="#table56">56</a> below the xylenols) have little or no commercial
importance at this time.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#table56">56</a> lists the tar acids by commercial name, chemical name,
boiling point of the pure compound, and average percentage present
in coal tar. Boiling point is shown because the several tariff classifications
covering tar acids under the acts of 1922 and 1930 (pars. 27
and 1651) depend upon distillation range (boiling points) for classification
and assessment of duty (see pp. <a href="#Page_119">119</a> and <a href="#Page_124">124</a>).</p>

<p>Since the quantities of tar acids present in coal tar are small (see
table <a href="#table56">56</a>), it is usually uneconomical to distill coal tar completely
unless the creosote oil and pitch can be marketed profitably. Beginning
in 1936, production of tar acids in the United States was
increased by the practice of topping. Topping is the recovery in
tar distillation of the light fractions only, leaving a residual thin
enough to flow through the pipe lines to supply fuel to open hearth
and other type furnaces. These light fractions contain the naphthalene
and tar acids. The practice permits recovery of these products
from tar to be used as fuel, thus providing a new alternative intermediate
between the two older practices of either complete distillation
or using the undistilled tar as fuel.</p>

<p>In the United States, consumption of most of the tar acids greatly
exceeds the quantities extracted from tar, necessitating large production
of synthetic phenol and importation of large quantities of the
cresols and xylenols. The calculated amount of these tar acids present
in the tar produced in this country vastly exceeds present day
requirements. Table <a href="#table57">57</a> shows the approximate amounts of the
several tar acids contained in the coal tar produced and distilled in
1936. These estimates are based on a 1936 production of coal tar
of 560,385,578 gallons and a distillation of 292,140,249 gallons. The
calculation is made by using the percentage of tar acids in tar shown
in table <a href="#table56">56</a> and converting the gallons to pounds in accordance with
the specific weights of the pure tar acids. Actual production of all
tar acids in the United States in 1936 was about 29 million pounds.</p>

<p>The several tar acids are discussed in detail under the following
heads:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Phenol.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The cresols, xylenols, and cresylic acid.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Synthetic tar acids other than phenol.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-2">PHENOL</h3>

<h4 id="heading17-2-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>Phenol (commonly called carbolic acid) is a tar acid obtained
from two sources: (<i>a</i>) From one of the fractions recovered in the
distillation of coal tar, a byproduct resulting from the manufacture
of coke in byproduct ovens, and from the manufacture of coal gas;
(<i>b</i>) from benzol, by synthesis. The second source has been the more
important since 1923. Phenol, when pure, is a colorless substance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of interlaced or separate needle-shaped crystals with a characteristic
aromatic odor. It is corrosive to the skin and to mucous membrane.
When pure it is water white, melts at about 42° C., and boils at about
181.5° C. It was discovered in 1834 by Runge.</p>

<p>Phenol is used today chiefly as a component of tar-acid resins.
It is also widely used as an antiseptic and disinfectant, in the manufacture
of explosives (picric acid and ammonium picrate), and as
an intermediate for certain dyes and medicinals. Salicylic acid and
its derivatives—aspirin, salol, and methyl salicylate (artificial oil
of wintergreen)—are important medicinals made from phenol.
Another use is in the extraction of lubricating oils. The relative
importance of these various uses in recent years is indicated by table
<a href="#table58">58</a>, which gives the estimated domestic consumption of phenol by
uses in 1936-37.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-2-2">United States production.</h4>

<p>Prior to 1914 United States production of phenol averaged about
a million pounds a year and was entirely the natural product obtained
from distillates of coal tar. Increased demand during the
World War was met by several synthetic phenol processes, which
utilized in part the vast quantities of benzol available. Our output
of phenol reached 64 million pounds in 1917 and 107 million pounds
in 1918. When the armistice was signed stocks on hand in the United
States totaled between 35 million and 40 million pounds, estimated
at three times the annual consumption at that time for nonmilitary
purposes. As a result the price dropped from about 45 cents to 6
cents a pound, and the synthetic plants were closed.</p>

<p>The limited quantities of phenol available to synthetic resin makers
prior to and during the World War caused much concern to that
industry and led to research work for substitutes, work resulting in
the development of many new and modified types of resins in which
tar acids other than phenol were used. But notwithstanding the use
of these other tar acids the increased demand for synthetic resins
used up the accumulated stocks of phenol sooner than was expected.</p>

<p>Of the phenol produced in the United States from 1919 through
1923 a large part was natural phenol but the rapid increase in demand
and the improvement of processes for synthetic phenol had by
1923 resulted in four companies beginning production of the synthetic
article. The rapid increase in output, from about 3 million
pounds in 1923 to about 15 million pounds in 1925, was almost entirely
in synthetic phenol. Since then a large part of the domestic
production has continued to be synthetic, although the production
of natural phenol since 1935 has been about four times that of 1929.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>Adequate quantities of coal tar are usually available to produce
sufficient natural phenol to meet a substantial part of our requirements,
if it were all recovered, but the quantity actually produced is
determined in part by the demand for other coal-tar products, and
in part by the value of the tar as fuel. More than 50 percent of the
tar produced has been burned as fuel, principally at the coke ovens
or nearby steel mills.</p>

<p>The domestic production and sales of phenol, natural and synthetic
combined, are shown in table <a href="#table59">59</a>.</p>

<p id="heading17-2-2-1"><i>Grades produced for resins.</i>—Increased production of phenol in
recent years is largely due to the demand from makers of synthetic
resins. A number of grades are regularly produced for this purpose,
though it is believed that the technical grade is the principal one used
in resins. The several grades are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) USP.—Either natural or synthetic. This grade contains not
less than 98 percent phenol.</p>

<p>(2) Technical.—Various grades containing from 80 to 95 percent
phenol, of which the two most important are 82-84 percent and 90-92
percent.</p>

<p>(3) Mixtures.—Containing from 30 percent to 80 percent phenol
and the remainder of the isomeric cresols.</p>

<p id="heading17-2-2-2"><i>Producers.</i>—Natural phenol is obtained in the distillation of coal
tar and to a smaller extent in the purification of ammonia liquors in
coke and gas plants. In 1937 there were four producers of natural
phenol with plants located at Philadelphia, Pa., Follansbee, W. Va.,
Indianapolis, Ind., and Pittsburgh, Pa. All these are tar distillers
recovering creosote oil, pitch, cresylic acid, naphthalene, and other
crudes from coal tar.</p>

<p>Synthetic phenol is made from benzene, either by sulfonation followed
by alkaline fusion, or by chlorination and subsequent heating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
under pressure with caustic soda. It is produced in large quantities by
two firms, one at Midland, Mich., and the other at St. Louis, Mo. A
third producer is building a plant at North Tonawanda, N. Y., using a
process recently developed in Germany. Operation of this unit will
probably start late in 1938.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-2-3">World production.</h4>

<p>Natural phenol is recovered in practically all European countries
and in Japan. Germany and the United Kingdom are the principal
producers and have also been the leading exporters. Synthetic phenol
was made in Germany as early as 1900, and during the World War.
Plants for synthetic phenol recently installed are now in operation in
Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, and Italy.</p>

rich in phenol and other tar acids, are available. Prior to the World
War the United Kingdom was the principal source of phenol, and
of the other products of tar distillation. During the war several
synthetic processes of commercial importance were developed, but
they were discontinued after its close. A new synthetic unit has recently
been installed in England and is now in operation. Increasing
consumption of phenol in synthetic resins during the last decade,
particularly in the last several years, has changed the United Kingdom
from an exporter to an importer of phenol. Estimated consumption
of phenol in the United Kingdom is given as 20 million
pounds annually—principally in synthetic resins, and in lesser
quantities in dyes, intermediates, antiseptics, and disinfectants.</p>

<p>In Germany the phenol recovered in 1936 amounted to about 20
million pounds, and recently three commercial units have been installed
for the production of synthetic phenol, one with a reported
daily output of 11,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Natural phenol is also recovered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, and Spain. Synthetic phenol
has recently been produced for the first time in Belgium and Italy.
The quantities normally produced in these countries are small and
are supplemented by imports from Great Britain and Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>The production of phenol in Japan has increased rapidly and has
been sufficient since 1930 to meet domestic requirements. The estimated
output increased from 300,000 pounds in 1927 to more than
3 million pounds annually in recent years. The Miike Dyestuffs
Works is reported to be producing synthetic phenol.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-2-4">United States imports.</h4>

<p id="heading17-2-4-1"><i>Rates of duty.</i>—Prior to September 6, 1916, phenol was imported
free of duty. Since that date it has been dutiable at the various
rates shown in table <a href="#table61">61</a>. Under the act of 1930 the rate of duty is
3½ cents per pound and 20 percent ad valorem on the American
selling price (the wholesale price of a similar competitive article
manufactured in the United States).<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In 1934, the principal destinations in order of importance were
China, Italy, and Canada; in 1935 Germany, China, Japan, and Belgium;
and in 1936 China, Belgium, and the Netherlands.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-2-6">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>Before the World War our average annual consumption of phenol
was 5 million pounds, of which about 80 percent was imported from
Great Britain and Germany. These countries produced phenol in
excess of their consumption, and phenol was on the free list in the
United States.</p>

<p>In September 1916 phenol became dutiable. The demand was increasing
rapidly because of the use of phenol in the manufacture of
picric acid, an explosive. To meet the wartime demand at home and
abroad large scale production of synthetic phenol sprang up in the
United States. But the end of the war not only shut off the largest
part of the demand but left the producers with large stocks on hand.
The price dropped sharply and the production of synthetic phenol
ceased.</p>

<p>Since 1922 there has been a gradually increasing demand for phenol
in the United States, chiefly for use in the manufacture of synthetic
resins, and production has increased to meet this demand as
shown in table <a href="#table66">66</a>.</p>

<p>The manufacture of synthetic phenol was revived about 1923.
Imports were quite small as compared with production, especially
after 1927. At first this was probably due primarily to the protection
given by the duty which had been increased in 1922.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But with the
increase in volume of production in the United States the price decreased
and since 1933 the United States producers have enjoyed a
substantial export business. It may therefore be doubted that in
recent years there would have been any substantial imports even
if phenol had been free of duty.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-3">THE CRESOLS, XYLENOLS, AND CRESYLIC ACID</h3>

<p>Reference to table <a href="#table56">56</a>, page <a href="#Page_109">109</a>, will show that, as distillation of
coal tar proceeds and the temperature of distillation is increased,
the phenol fraction is followed in order by the three cresols and
then by the six xylenols. Each of these tar acids is a definite
chemical compound with definite physical properties. Consideration
of them as raw materials for synthetic resins is complicated by the
fact that they are generally used in mixtures and that the commercial
term, cresylic acid, applied to many of these mixtures has no
definite relationship to the precise chemical terminology. Yet since
the term cresylic acid is so widely used in commerce, since the tariff
provides for imports under that name, and since the statistics available
are in part in terms of cresylic acid and in part in terms of
cresols and xylenols it is impossible to present the complete picture
on the basis of the correct chemical terminology.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-3-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p id="heading17-3-1-1"><i>The cresols.</i>—The cresols are isomeric tar acids obtained from coal
tar by fractional distillation. Their combined content averages about
1 percent of domestic coal tar. The total cresol content is divided
in about the following proportions: 40 percent metacresol, 35 percent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>orthocresol, and 25 percent paracresol. The cresols are marketed
in a number of types and grades including mixtures of ortho, meta,
and para; mixtures of meta and para; separated ortho, meta, and
para; and also in mixtures with phenol and the xylenols.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-2"><i>Metacresol</i> (chemically, 3-methyl phenol) is a colorless to yellow
liquid with a phenol-like odor. When pure, it melts at 11° C., boils
at 202.8° C., and has a specific gravity of 1.03. It is used in the
manufacture of synthetic resins, photographic developers, explosives,
disinfectant soaps, paint and varnish removers, to remove ink from
newsprint, to soften and reclaim rubber, and in intermediates for
dyes and perfume materials.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-3"><i>Orthocresol</i> (chemically, 2-methyl phenol) is a colorless, crystalline
product with a phenol-like odor, melting at 30° C., boiling at 190.8°
C., and having a specific gravity of 1.04. It is used in the manufacture
of coumarin (flavor), antiseptics, disinfectants, and fumigants.
It is not used to any extent in synthetic resins.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-4"><i>Paracresol</i> (chemically, 4-methyl phenol) is a colorless, crystalline
substance with a phenol-like odor, melting at 35° C., boiling at 201.8°
C., and having a specific gravity of 1.03. It is used in the manufacture
of intermediates, dyes, disinfectants, and fumigants, in medicine,
and in mixture with metacresol in synthetic resins. Domestic production
of synthetic paracresol was announced early in 1938 by
Swann &amp; Co., Birmingham, Ala.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-5"><i>Metaparacresol</i> is a combination of approximately 60 percent meta
and 40 percent para cresol obtained in the fractional distillation of
mixed cresols. The ortho isomer is distilled off, leaving a residue
of metaparacresol. It is widely used in the manufacture of synthetic
resins.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-6"><i>Cresol.</i>—The term cresol used without further qualification indicates
a mixture of the three isomers in substantially the same proportions
in which they are found in coal tar. The United States
Pharmacopoeia describes cresol, a mixture of isomeric cresols obtained
from coal tar, as a colorless or yellowish to brownish-yellow
or a pinkish, highly refractive liquid, becoming darker with age and
on exposure to light. It is widely used in synthetic resins, antiseptics
and disinfectants, and in medicine.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-7"><i>The xylenols.</i>—Shortly after the original patents on Bakelite resins
expired extensive research was begun for raw materials that would
give different properties to the resultant resins. This work led to a
study of the high-boiling tar acids, and methods of recovery for
some of them were commercially developed. Among those obtained
from coal tar are the six isomeric xylenols, methylethyl phenol, and
one of the trimethyl phenols (see table <a href="#table56">56</a>). Coal tar contains about
0.2 percent xylenols and 0.5 percent other high-boiling tar acids.</p>

<p>The principal uses for these products have been in the preparation
of high-phenol coefficient disinfectants, and recently in the replacement
of phenol and cresols in synthetic resins. It was found, for
example, that 3: 5 xylenol reacts with formaldehyde faster than either
metacresol or phenol. Numerous patents have been granted on the
use of these high-boiling acids in the production of synthetic resins.</p>

<p>The xylenols, when pure, are colorless, crystalline substances boiling
between 211° and 225° C. They are usually marketed in mixtures
containing from 50 to 80 percent xylenols and 20 to 50 percent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
cresols. There is commercial production of at least one of the separated
xylenols (3: 5). An appreciable part of our imports of crude
cresylic acid and of our production of cresylic acid contains high
percentages of the xylenols.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-8"><i>Other high-boiling tar acids.</i>—The other high-boiling tar acids are
ortho ethylphenol, meta ethylphenol, para ethylphenol, methyl ethylphenol,
and the three isomeric trimethyl phenols. Several of these
have been isolated from coal tar. All of them, when pure, are crystalline
compounds with boiling points ranging between 206° and
235° C. There has been little, if any, commercial production of this
group up to this time. They are known, however, to have very high
phenol coefficients, a property which would make them suitable for
use in disinfectants. Little is known as yet concerning their application
in synthetic resins.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-1-9"><i>Cresylic acid.</i>—Cresylic acid is a generic term now applied to mixtures
of tar acids in widely varying proportions. As defined in the
literature and as formerly used in commerce the term identified a
mixture of ortho, meta, and para cresols in the proportions in which
they occur in coal tar. This proportion is approximately 40 percent
metacresol, 35 percent orthocresol, and 25 percent paracresol. But
in recent years the designation cresylic acid has been applied to all
sorts of mixtures of tar acids boiling above 190° C. Practically every
maker of synthetic resins, antiseptics, and disinfectants has his
own specifications for cresylic acid; it may be any mixture in almost
any proportions of the three cresols, the six isomeric xylenols, and
the higher boiling tar acids. Imports of crude cresylic acid are understood
to be largely xylenol mixtures containing low percentages
of the cresols. This loose application of cresylic acid in recent years
is due to the increased commercial application of the high-boiling
tar acids, especially the xylenols.</p>

<p>Under the Tariff Act of 1930 refined cresylic acid, that having a
purity of 75 percent or more, is dutiable under paragraph 27 at 3½
cents per pound and 20 percent ad valorem based on American selling
price or United States value; while crude cresylic acid, that having
a purity of less than 75 percent, is free under paragraph 1651.
The provision in paragraph 27 reads, “cresylic acid which on being
subjected to distillation yields in the portion distilling below two
hundred and fifteen degrees centigrade, a quantity of tar acids
equal to or more than 75 per centum of the original distillate.” Under
this provision cresylic acid may include an endless number of combinations
of tar acids and may or may not contain any of the isomeric
cresols. Of the 17 or more tar acids known to exist in coal tar (see
table <a href="#table56">56</a>), only 8 have boiling points above 215° C. It would seem
to be more accurate and more in line with present day usage to have
the tariff drop the designation cresylic acid in favor of more definite
terms based on composition, such as cresols and cresol mixes, xylenol
and xylenol mixes, etc.</p>

<p>About 60 percent of our consumption of cresylic acid is in synthetic
resins and the remainder in the manufacture of insecticides,
antiseptics, disinfectants, and other coal-tar products, such as intermediates
for dyes, plasticizers for nitrocellulose, etc.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-3-2">United States production.</h4>

<p id="heading17-3-2-1"><i>The cresols.</i>—There is large production of cresol, metaparacresol,
and orthocresol in the United States. Commercial production of
paracresol was reported for the first time in 1934, and of metacresol
in 1935.</p>

<p>Statistics of domestic production and sales are publishable only for

</div>

<p>The trend of domestic production of the several cresols is upward.
In 1937 the output of all grades and types of cresols was 13,745,271
pounds with sales of 13,251,345 pounds, valued at $1,071,965. The
practice of topping coal tar will greatly increase the output of the
cresols as well as of other tar acids and naphthalene.</p>

<p>There are five domestic producers of cresol, three each of orthocresol
and metaparacresol, and two of metacresol and paracresol. All except
one of these makers recover natural phenol, cresylic acids, and other
tar acids. Refining plants are located at Pittsburgh, Pa., Philadelphia,
Pa., Indianapolis, Ind., and Follansbee, W. Va. Domestic
production of synthetic paracresol was first announced in 1938.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-2-2"><i>The xylenols.</i>—There has been a large domestic production of mixed
xylenols in recent years. These mixtures, containing from 50 to 80
percent xylenols, are marketed as cresylic acid. Statistics of domestic
production, and sales are therefore included in table <a href="#table68">68</a>. It is
estimated that the output of xylenols and xylenol mixtures in 1935
exceeded 750,000 pounds and exceeded 1,250,000 pounds in 1937. At
least one of the separated xylenols (1: 3: 5) has been produced commercially
in the United States since 1935, but statistics of its production
are not publishable.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-2-3"><i>Other high-boiling tar acids.</i>—There was no reported domestic
production of the other high-boiling acids prior to 1935 and the data
obtained for that year are probably incomplete. Estimated output
was 200,000 pounds in 1935, 250,000 pounds in 1936, and 300,000
pounds in 1937. These estimates are based on production of mixtures
of high-boiling acids.</p>

<p id="heading17-3-2-4"><i>Cresylic acid.</i>—Domestic production and sales statistics for so-called
crude cresylic acid are not publishable. It is known, however,
that production of the crude is small compared with our output of
refined cresylic acid. It is usually more economical for the producer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
to prepare the mixture of tar acids to the specifications of the purchaser,
rather than to leave part of the refining operations to be
performed by the latter. The fact that imports of cresylic acid are
chiefly of crude is largely due to the different tariff treatment of crude
and refined.</p>

<p>Domestic production of refined cresylic acid was confined to one
or two firms until 1928, when there were four makers. Statistics of
production and sales are not publishable for the years prior to 1929,
though it may be stated that the annual domestic output increased
each year to supply the increased demand. Table <a href="#table68">68</a> shows production
and sales from 1929 to 1934, inclusive. Data for later years are
not publishable.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the composition of cresylic acid has gradually
been changed from a mixture of the isomeric cresols to mixtures of
cresols, xylenols, and high-boiling tar acids. The cresols, formerly included
under cresylic acid statistics, are now shown separately. For
this reason the data in table <a href="#table68">68</a> do not fully reflect the increased output
of these tar acids in recent years. Statistics for years prior to 1931
probably include all of the tar acids except phenol, while those for
subsequent years do not include the separated cresols. In 1934 the
production of refined cresylic acid was 10,949,860 pounds, and in addition
recovery of the several cresols amounted to 11,798,276 pounds
making a total of 22,748,136 pounds as compared with a total of
14,601,534 pounds in 1929 and 17,305,308 pounds in 1930.</p>

<p>During 1936 and the first part of 1937 a serious shortage of cresylic
acid existed in the domestic market owing to increased demand by synthetic
resin makers. The output in 1936 exceeded that in 1935 and the
production in 1937 was appreciably higher than in 1936. These increases
are due to the recovery of appreciable quantities at several new
distillation plants, the topping of large amounts of tar hitherto not
processed, and increased production by present recovery units.</p>

<p>There are many grades of cresylic acid, most of which are prepared
by mixing or blending to individual specifications. Every large consumer
apparently has his own specifications. In addition to these
special mixtures there are the following standard blends:</p>

<p>(1) Ninety-nine percent high-boiling, straw color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>(2) Low-boiling, straw color.</p>

<p>(3) Special resin grade, high-boiling.</p>

<p>There are four domestic producers of cresylic acid with recovery and
refining units at Pittsburgh, Pa., Philadelphia, Pa., Indianapolis, Ind.,
and Follansbee, W. Va. The last three mentioned are refining plants
operated in conjunction with a number of tar distillation units widely
scattered throughout the country. These units usually recover crude
tar-acid fractions in the distillation of tar and ship them to these refining
plants for separation and refining. All in this group are purchasers
of coal tar. The fourth producer operates a byproduct recovery
unit in connection with the company’s coke-oven operations. Part of
the coal tar produced is distilled to recover the several products, including
creosote oil, tar acids, and naphthalene, and the residual pitch
is mixed with the remaining undistilled tar and used for fuel. The
shortage of tar acids and naphthalene in 1936 caused this producer to
begin the topping of tar.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-3-3">Foreign production.</h4>

<p>The cresols are produced in the United Kingdom, Germany, France,
the Netherlands, Belgium, and other European countries. Coal tar
recovered in the United Kingdom is principally gas tar, which is much
richer in tar acids than coke-oven tar, the principal source in the
United States. This is true because low temperature carbonization of
coal yields greater quantities of tar acids than are obtained in the tar
from byproduct coke ovens. Exports to the United States are chiefly
mixtures which can enter as crude cresylic acid.</p>

<p>Cresylic acid is recovered in all the countries of Europe, Great
Britain and Germany being the leading producers and the principal
exporters. Increasing demand in these countries for synthetic resins
made from cresylic acid has greatly reduced the quantities available
for export in recent years.</p>

<p>Great Britain is probably the world’s largest producer of cresylic
acid, and for many years has been the principal exporter to the
United States. This position is due to the large available supply of
gas-house tar, and to an ample market for all the products of tar
distillation. In 1935 the tar distilled in England, Wales, and Scotland
totaled 360 million gallons, of which 55 percent was gas-house
tar.</p>

<p>British production of all grades of cresylic acid averages between
35 million and 42 million pounds annually, of which from 12 million
to 20 million pounds are exported. Many British producers market
their tar products through pools and associations. There is a cresylic
acid pool, a phenol pool, and at least two creosote oil export associations,
a pitch marketing association, and a benzol association. One
of the principal grades of cresylic acid produced in Great Britain
is “American duty-free specification.”</p>

<p>The processes for recovery of the cresols (fractional distillation)
usually yield products more than 75 percent pure and most of the
consumers of mixed or prepared cresols require products of high
purity. This explains why there are no imports less than 75 percent
pure, notwithstanding that they are duty-free under paragraph
1651.</p>

<p>Under the act of 1930 cresols of 90 percent or greater purity are
assessed for duty at 20 percent ad valorem and 3½ cents per pound
while cresols 75.1 to 89.9 percent pure are assessed for duty at 40
percent ad valorem and 7 cents per pound. Naturally, since the duty
on imports below 90 percent pure is double that on imports over 90
percent pure there are no imports of the former.</p>

<p>Imports of crude cresylic acid are shown in table <a href="#table79">79</a> and those
of refined cresylic acid in table <a href="#table80">80</a>. Imports by principal sources
are shown in tables <a href="#table81">81</a> and <a href="#table82">82</a>, for crude and refined, respectively.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>In 1931 practically all imports of refined cresylic acid were from
the United Kingdom and consigned to one importer in New York.
In 1932 about 73 percent of the total dutiable imports were consigned
to the same firm. From these data and from a conference
with representatives of the importer it would appear that the imports
were not cresylic acid in its original meaning (a mixture of cresols
in their natural proportions), nor in the broadened commercial meaning
(including with the cresols, xylenols and higher boiling tar
acids), but were chiefly a product consisting largely of a single
cresol separated from its two isomers. Treasury Decision 46146,
effective March 11, 1933, closed the classification of refined cresylic
acid to products of this type and imports thereafter under this head
have been much smaller. After 1927 substantial amounts of the
imports were reexported with benefit of drawback.</p>

<p>The imports of crude cresylic acid are also not of the type which
the domestic producer would sell by that name. Far from being a
straight run mixture of the cresol and higher boiling tar acids, they
are usually a mixture of fractions which have been separated, and
then chosen and combined so that they will meet both the tariff
requirement (i. e., less than 75 percent of the total product will distill
over at 215° C.) and the specifications of the purchasers. Customer’s
specifications are so drawn that the product will fill his special
needs or can easily be broken down by fractional distillation in this
country into elements, one or more of which will be so usable. Thus
although imported crude cresylic acid must keep within the limitations
set by the tariff it approaches as nearly as possible the type
of cresylic acid which, if produced in this country, would be termed
refined, since it was produced to meet the specifications of the consumer.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-3-5">United States exports.</h4>

<p>Exports of the cresols and of cresylic acid are not shown in official
statistics and exports of these products as such are probably negligible,
but there are appreciable exports of antiseptics, insecticides,
and disinfectants in which they are incorporated, as well as of products
or parts of products molded of resins made from cresylic acid.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-3-6">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>British coal tar is principally of gas-house origin and contains a
higher percentage of tar acids (cresylic acid and phenol) than coke-oven
tar, the principal kind recovered in the United States. The
recovery of these tar acids from either kind of tar is usually not
practicable, unless the distiller can dispose of the major products,
creosote oil and pitch. British distillers have in the past ordinarily
had a market for all their products; exporting large quantities of
creosote oil to the United States, pitch to continental Europe, and tar
acids and naphthalene to the United States, Germany, and other countries.
Domestic distillers have sold cresylic acid, creosote oil,
naphthalene, etc., in local markets in competition with duty-free
imports from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and
Germany, but have found it difficult to dispose of pitch. The domestic
production of coal tar ordinarily exceeded 600 million gallons,
approximately one-half of which has been burned as fuel. Since the
profit in distilling depends upon the markets for all of the joint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
products of the distillation, the large amount remaining undistilled
can be understood.</p>

<p>The domestic production of cresylic acid may be expected to
increase substantially, for several reasons: (1) The principal foreign
producing countries have decreased exports because of increased demand
for some of the coal-tar distillation products at home; (2)
increased world prices; and (3) the development of topping, which
allows the production of tar acids and naphthalene from coal tar
without complete distillation.</p>

<p>Imports of refined cresylic acid are unimportant because the duty
on the refined is high relative to the duty-free condition of the crude.
Most of the imports of refined are either reexported or used in the
manufacture of one proprietary antiseptic. The principal domestic
market for cresylic acid is as a raw material for synthetic resins,
and most of the domestic refined and most of the duty-free imported
crude is now consumed by this industry. It may therefore
be said that practically all imports of cresylic acid are duty-free
and that, while they are sometimes refined by the consumer, they
compete directly with domestic production of refined grades.</p>

<p>Phenol, already discussed, is closely related to cresylic acid—in
chemical composition, in production by distillation from coal tar,
and in use as a raw material for synthetic resins. To a considerable
extent the proportions of phenol and cresylic acid used in the manufacture
of tar-acid resins can be altered to take advantage of the
changing price differential between the two.</p>

<p>All of the separated or mixed cresols are produced in commercial
quantities in this country. Consumption in the United States,
especially of types and grades used in synthetic resins, has increased
appreciably in recent years, and is supplied chiefly by domestic
production. A comparison of the quantity and value of domestic
production and of imports in 1934 is shown in table <a href="#table83">83</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-4">SYNTHETIC TAR ACIDS OTHER THAN PHENOL</h3>

<p>Certain synthetic tar acids other than synthetic phenol are used
commercially in the manufacture of synthetic resins in the United
States. Among these are para tertiary amyl phenol, para tertiary
butyl phenol, ortho phenyl phenol, para phenyl phenol, and resorcinal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<h4 id="heading17-4-1">Para tertiary amyl phenol.</h4>

<p>Para tertiary amyl phenol is made by reacting amylene with phenol
in the presence of sulphuric acid as a catalyst. At ordinary temperatures
it is a solid, melting at about 88° C. and boiling between
250°-265° C. Its use is of increasing importance as a component in
tar-acid resins, especially in oil-soluble varnish resins. Owing to its
phenol coefficient of approximately 60, it is also used as a germicide,
fumigant, and insecticide. Commercial production was reported for
the first time in 1933. Since then the output has increased appreciably
each year, accompanied by material reductions in sales
prices.</p>

<p>According to United States Patent No. 1,800,295, dated April 14,
1931, a resin fast to light and soluble in oils is obtained by heating
82 parts of p-tertiary amyl phenol with 90 parts of formaldehyde,
in the presence of sodium hydroxide. This substituted phenol resin
passes slowly into the infusible state, thus permitting better control
of the reaction.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-4-2">Para tertiary butyl phenol.</h4>

<p>Para tertiary butyl phenol is a white solid with an aromatic odor,
melting at approximately 100° C. It is a new commercial product and
is used in resins for paints and varnishes. It is the most important
resin material in this group.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-4-3">Phenyl phenols.</h4>

<p>Both ortho and para phenyl phenol are commercially produced
and are used to some extent in resins to replace phenol. The ortho
isomer is a white solid boiling at 284° C. and melting at about 56°
C. It is used chiefly as a germicide, though small quantities are used
in resins.</p>

<p>Para phenyl phenol is a white solid melting at about 165° C. and
boiling at 322° C. Commercial production was reported for the first
time in 1933. The output has increased each year since and the selling
price has gradually declined.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-4-4">Resorcinol.</h4>

<p>Resorcinol, usually obtained by fusing meta benzene disulphonic
acid with caustic soda, is a colorless, crystalline substance with a
peculiar odor. It melts at 119° C. and boils at 276° C. It is used in
medicine, in the manufacture of intermediates and dyes, and to some
extent in synthetic resins. Resorcinol condenses with formaldehyde
at such a rapid rate that some means must be applied to slow up the
reaction. It is used to increase the rate of condensation of tar-acid
resins and to reduce the danger of sticking or undercure.</p>

<p>Domestic production of resorcinol has decreased in recent years.
Its relatively high cost is probably an important factor in limiting
its use in synthetic resins.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-5">FORMALDEHYDE</h3>

<h4 id="heading17-5-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>At ordinary temperature and pressure formaldehyde is a gas. It
enters commerce as formalin, an aqueous solution containing 40 percent
formaldehyde by volume (37 percent by weight) and from 6 to 14
percent methyl alcohol. It is generally made by the oxidation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
methyl alcohol. Commercial formalin contains polymers which tend
to precipitate in water solution; these are kept in solution by allowing
from 6 to 14 percent methyl alcohol to remain in the solution.</p>

<p>The principal use of formaldehyde is in the manufacture of synthetic
resins. Other uses are (in the order of their importance):
In the manufacture of synthetic indigo; in the manufacture of hydrosulphite;
as a disinfectant, deodorant, and preservative; as a fungicide;
in embalming fluids; in tanning leather; and in the manufacture
of coated paper and wallpaper.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-5-2">United States production.</h4>

<p>The domestic output of formaldehyde has increased with the increased
demand by resin makers. Production and sales in 1937
were more than double those in 1930. There are three domestic
makers, two of which produce methyl alcohol, the raw material.
Their plants are located in New Jersey and Oklahoma.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-5-3">Production in other countries.</h4>

<p>Formaldehyde is produced in England, Germany, France, Czechoslovakia,
Italy, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Canada.
Production data are not available but Germany and England are
probably the leading foreign producers. Estimated productive capacity
in the Soviet Union is given as 10 million pounds annually;
in Japan 6.5 million pounds; in France 4 million pounds; and in
Italy 3 million pounds.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-5-4">United States imports and exports.</h4>

<p>Imports of formaldehyde have been negligible since 1920 when
428,444 pounds, valued at $210,191, were imported. There were no
imports from 1928 until 1935, when 375 pounds valued at $72 were
imported from Canada. In 1936 imports amounted to 20 pounds,
valued at $14, from Switzerland.</p>

<p>The United States exports about 5 percent of its production of
formaldehyde. Canada is the principal destination of exports, and
prior to 1934 Japan was an important market. Table <a href="#table85">85</a> shows exports
of formaldehyde to principal markets, in recent years.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-5-5">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>The competitive situation with respect to formaldehyde is determined
largely by the output and price of the raw material, methanol.
The United States produces large quantities of synthetic and natural
methanol and is a net exporter of that product. Both methanol
and formaldehyde are produced in many foreign countries, and foreign
production is expanding. Although methanol is now the main,
if not the sole, raw material utilized in making formaldehyde, plants
for making the latter direct from natural gas, or from petroleum gas
hydrocarbons are contemplated or actually under construction.
Should such processes develop to an appreciable extent, the competitive
situation of the United States may change, but in such case it
is unlikely that this country would be so affected as to change its
position as a moderate exporter.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-6">HEXAMETHYLENETETRAMINE</h3>

<h4 id="heading17-6-1">Description and uses.</h4>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramine is a white crystalline powder made by
the interaction of formaldehyde and ammonia. It is used in tar-acid
resins to replace formaldehyde, though its higher cost has limited
its use to small proportions as a finishing or hardening agent.
Other uses are as an internal antiseptic in medicine (marketed under
trade names such as Urotropin, Cystogen, Aminoform, Urisol, and
Cystamin), as an accelerator in the vulcanization of rubber (a declining
use), and in artificial cork. During the World War it was
used in gas masks as an absorbent for phosgene.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-6-2">United States production.</h4>

<p>The domestic production of hexamethylenetetramine declined during
the depression, but has been increasing in the last few years.
Production in 1937, however, was still below that of 1929. Statistics
of production are shown in table <a href="#table86">86</a>.</p>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramine is made by two firms in New Jersey and
by one in West Virginia. The raw materials utilized are formaldehyde
and liquid or anhydrous ammonia. One company makes its own requirements
of both, and another makes its own formaldehyde. Most
of the production of hexamethylenetetramine is sold, marketed in
barrels, drums, kegs, and cans.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-6-3">Production in other countries.</h4>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramine is made in a number of foreign countries,
with Germany probably the leading foreign producer. Exports from
Germany declined from 445,000 pounds in 1931 to 182,000 pounds in
1934, the decline being due chiefly to the expansion of production in
countries previously large importers, particularly the United Kingdom,
Japan, Czechoslovakia, and France.</p>

<p>Imports of hexamethylenetetramine in 1928 came principally from
the United Kingdom, the remainder from Germany. In 1929 they
came wholly from Germany; in 1932 and 1933 from Belgium; and
in 1934 principally from Canada, with the rest from the United
Kingdom. In 1936 Belgium supplied 7,166 pounds valued at $1,368
and Germany 330 pounds valued at $142.</p>

<p>Exports of hexamethylenetetramine are not shown in official statistics.
It is known, however, that some has been exported, and that
in 1933, at least, exports exceeded imports.</p>

<h4 id="heading17-6-5">Competitive conditions.</h4>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramine is made from formaldehyde and ammonia,
of which there are ample supplies in the United States. The
market for hexamethylenetetramine is limited, and imports are small.
It is made in numerous foreign countries, Germany being probably
the principal potential competitor.</p>

<h3 id="heading17-7">FURFURAL</h3>

<p>Furfural is an aldehyde found in oat hulls, rice hulls, corn cobs,
bran, and other farm waste products. Commercially it is obtained
in the United States from oat hulls and in the Soviet Union from
the husks of sunflower seeds. It is a colorless liquid, boiling at 158°
to 162° C. and freezing at minus 38° C. Its principal use is in
synthetic resins, of which tar acid-furfural is probably the most important.
These resins are used in molding, for impregnating, and in
coatings. Furfural is also used as a solvent for cellulose ethers and
esters, natural gums and resins, and in the manufacture of derivatives
useful as rubber chemicals.</p>

<p>Domestic production is entirely by one firm, located in Iowa. Production
and sales statistics are not publishable, but the maker has
stated that consumption is in “terms of millions of pounds per year.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading18">18. RAW MATERIALS FOR UREA RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>The principal raw materials entering into the manufacture of urea
resins are urea and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde has already been
discussed (see pp. <a href="#Page_133">133-135</a>) and urea and thiourea are discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="heading18-1">UREA</h3>

<p>Urea is a white crystalline material, made by condensing carbon
dioxide and ammonia under heat and pressure. It is an excellent
fertilizer because of its high nitrogen content (46.6 percent) but this
use is limited by its relatively high cost. Urea is an important synthetic
resin material, being a constituent of urea-formaldehyde resins,
known commercially under the trade names Beetleware and Plaskon.</p>

<p>Production of urea in the United States was started in 1916, when
the German supply was cut off. In 1920 the domestic output was
estimated at more than 200,000 pounds of fertilizer grade. Production
ceased in 1922. Urea in ammonia solution for use in the manufacture
of mixed fertilizer was first produced in 1933.</p>

<p>Crystal urea production in the United States was begun in 1935
and was largely made possible by the larger volume of urea in ammonia
solution manufactured for fertilizer use. Prior to that time
our requirements of crystal urea were imported, principally from
Germany. Consumers of resin grade urea report that the domestic
product is as good or better than the imported from Europe. The
domestic output of crystal urea in 1936 showed an appreciable increase
over that in 1935.</p>

<p>Statistics of imports of urea are given in table <a href="#table88">88</a>, showing imports
of all grades combined. Up to 1931, and again in 1936, the imports
were probably all for fertilizer use. From 1931 through 1935 some
portion of the imports went into the manufacture of resins, but even
in this period most of the imports were probably used in fertilizer.</p>

<p>Imports of urea enter the United States free of duty under paragraph
1793 of the Tariff Act of 1930. In spite of that fact a substantial
production in the United States has been achieved. This is
due, at least to a considerable extent, to the production of crude urea
in ammonia solution, which is used in ammoniating superphosphates
for fertilizer use. It is shipped by tank car but would be difficult
to transport by ship. The volume market for this form of the
product has aided in the production of crystal urea for both resin
and fertilizer use.</p>

<h3 id="heading18-2">THIOUREA</h3>

<p>Thiourea (thiocarbamide) is a white crystalline solid, melting at
180° C. It is made commercially by treating a solution of calcium
cyanamide with sulphur and ammonium sulphide or with hydrogen
sulphide and ammonia. The principal uses of thiourea are in making
intermediates and pharmaceuticals, as a photographic developer, as
an insecticide, and in medicine. Because of the water resistance it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
imparts it was for some time widely used in urea resins. During the
past few years, however, its use in resins has declined sharply owing
to its deleterious action on ordinary molds and its slow rate of cure.
In molding compounds, thiourea requires about 10 minutes curing
time as compared with 3 minutes or less for urea resins and tar-acid
resins. Since ways have been found to fabricate water-resistant
urea resins without using thiourea, the consumption of thiourea in
this use has declined.</p>

<p>There is no known commercial domestic production of thiourea.</p>

<p>Imports through the New York Customs District, according to
invoice analyses made by the Tariff Commission, are shown in table
<a href="#table90">90</a>. Thiourea is dutiable at 25 percent under paragraph 5 of the
act of 1930.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="heading19">19. RAW MATERIALS FOR VINYL RESINS</h2>

</div>

<p>Vinyl resins are made chiefly from vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride.</p>

<h3 id="heading19-1">Description and uses.</h3>

<p>Vinyl acetate is an unsaturated ester of the hypothetical vinyl
alcohol. It is made from acetylene and acetic acid, and is a colorless
liquid with a pleasant sweetish odor, boiling at 73° C. On account
of its tendency to polymerize to polyvinyl acetate, a trace of copper
salt is added for shipment. To render the vinyl acetate chemically
active again, the copper salt is removed by distillation. At present
the sole use of vinyl acetate is for the manufacture of synthetic
resins. (See pp. <a href="#Page_43">43-50</a>.)</p>

<p>Vinyl chloride, a salt of vinyl alcohol, is obtained commercially
from acetylene. It is a gas (boiling at about minus 14° C.) used in
the manufacture of synthetic resins. Vinyl chloride mixed with
vinyl acetate is polymerized to a synthetic resin.</p>

<h3 id="heading19-2">United States production.</h3>

<p>Until 1938 the one domestic maker of vinyl acetate produced only
experimental lots, the bulk of our requirements being imported from
Canada. In that year large units to manufacture vinyl acetate were
built at Niagara Falls, N. Y., and at Belle, W. Va. The remarkable
properties of safety glass made from vinyl resin sheets, together with
several other new and important applications of these resins, indicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
a demand for vinyl acetate sufficient to warrant these large
manufacturing units. The United States patents covering the processes
of manufacture of vinyl acetate are owned by the Canadian
producer, who has licensed the domestic makers.</p>

<p>Domestic production of vinyl chloride has increased from experimental
quantities in 1927 to large-scale commercial output, increasing
substantially each year since 1933.</p>

<h3 id="heading19-3">United States imports.</h3>

<p>There has been no import of vinyl chloride. Imports of vinyl
acetate (unpolymerized), entirely from Canada, are shown in table <a href="#table91">91</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heading19-4">Competitive conditions.</h3>

<p>Domestic consumption of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride has increased
in recent years from experimental to commercial quantities.
Many years of intensive research looking toward large outlets for
the resins made from these compounds has apparently been successful.
The largest single application indicated at this time is for
safety glass sheets.</p>

<p>The large increase in domestic consumption expected in the immediate
future will probably be supplied chiefly from expanding domestic
production and imports from Canada will probably decline
even under the reduced trade-agreement duty except to fill possible
temporary shortages.</p>

<p><i>Aminoplast.</i>—General terms for synthetic resins from amino or amido compounds.
A typical example is urea-formaldehyde.</p>

<p><i>Amorphous.</i>—Devoid of crystalline structure. This condition is rare. Many
substances which are apparently amorphous show microcrystallinity, particularly
under X-ray examination.</p>

<p><i>A-stage resins.</i>—Thermosetting resins reacted only to the initial stage where
they are soluble and fusible. The normal stage of a resin used for impregnation.</p>

<p><i>Bonding strength.</i>—The amount of adhesion between a binder and filler.
More specifically, the measure of the extent to which the composite layers of a
laminated product are bonded together.</p>

<p><i>Brittleness.</i>—Liability to break, generally to a conchoidal fracture.</p>

<p><i>B-stage resins.</i>—Thermosetting resins reacted to a stage where they soften
when heated and swell in contact with liquids but do not entirely fuse or dissolve.
This is the preferred stage for the resin in molding compositions.</p>

<p><i>Casting.</i>—Forming a material into a shape by pouring it when liquid into
a mold. The product from the mold is used as such or mechanically worked
in various ways to the final articles, as by sewing, cutting, blanking, turning,
drilling, forming, swaging, grinding, polishing, sanding, or routing.</p>

<p><i>Compressive strength.</i>—Resistance to deformation under applied pressure.</p>

<p><i>Condensation.</i>—A chemical reaction in which two or more molecules combine
with a separation of water or some other simple substance. Applied to synthetic
resins it means the formation of a resin by combination of a number of
molecules with elimination of water, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, or other
simple substance. Examples of condensation resins are alkyd, phenol-aldehyde,
and urea-formaldehyde resins. The final products are also called condensation-polymers.
(See Polymerization.)</p>

<p><i>Copolymerization.</i>—The term applied when two or more substances polymerize
at the same time to yield a product which is not a mixture of separate
polymers but a complex having properties different from either polymer alone.
For example, vinylite is produced by polymerization of a mixture of vinyl
acetate and vinyl chloride.</p>

<p><i>C-stage resins.</i>—Thermosetting resins in the final stage in which they are
infusible and insoluble. The state of the resin in the final molded article.</p>

<p><i>Curing.</i>—The change of a binder from the soluble-fusible condition to the
substantially insoluble-infusible form by chemical action. The heat-setting
of a resinoid. Action is analogous to vulcanization of rubber.</p>

<p><i>Dielectric strength.</i>—Voltage gradient at which a continuous electrical discharge
will take place between two electrodes when the material in question
is placed between the electrodes and a potential difference is applied to them.</p>

<p><i>Elastic.</i>—A substance which exhibits rubberlike properties or “high elasticity”
over a wide range of applied forces.</p>

<p><i>Elastic deformation.</i>—When a substance reverts to its original dimensions on
release of an applied stress.</p>

<p><i>Elastic limit.</i>—The point at which a body begins to yield under a stress;
that is, when the stress is equal to or greater than the internal friction.</p>

<p><i>Elasticity.</i>—The property by virtue of which a body reverts to its normal bulk
or shape after deformation by an applied force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p><i>Extrusion molding.</i>—A molding procedure for extended shapes of uniform
cross section, whereby a heat-softened substance is forced through an orifice of
form coinciding with the cross section of the article.</p>

<p><i>Flexibility.</i>—Capability of bending without breaking.</p>

<p><i>Gums.</i>—Viscous vegetable secretions which harden but, unlike resins, are
water soluble. The name is often applied, particularly in the varnish industry,
to natural resins such as copals.</p>

<p><i>Hardness.</i>—Property of substances determined by their ability to abrade
or indent one another. Often measured by the extent or depth of indentation
produced by a standard substance under a predetermined load.</p>

<p><i>Impact strength.</i>—The measure of toughness of a material. Generally determined
by the energy required to break a specimen in one blow.</p>

<p><i>Injection molding.</i>—A molding procedure whereby a heat-softened plastic
material is forced from a receptacle into a cavity which gives the article of
desired shape. Used particularly for thermoplastics since the scrap can be
reused. As soon as the composition in the mold cools sufficiently to be rigid,
the mold is opened and the molded article removed. An analogy of injection
molding in another field is shown by the linotype machine.</p>

<p><i>Inserts.</i>—Parts of a finished molded article which are of different material
from the molding composition but are set in place or positioned by the molding
operation.</p>

<p><i>Laminated products.</i>—Sheets of material united by a binder. For example,
sheets of paper or wood coated and/or impregnated with a resinous composition
and subjected to pressure, generally with heat.</p>

<p><i>Monomer.</i>—The simplest repeating structural unit of a polymer. For addition
polymers this represents the originally unpolymerized compound.</p>

<p><i>Phenoplast.</i>—A general term for phenol-aldehyde resins. Synonymous with
popular term “phenolics.”</p>

<p><i>Plastics.</i>—All substances that can be molded. In general a plastic is a substance
which behaves as a solid at stresses less than a certain amount known
as the yield value and as a viscous liquid at stresses greater than this. The
name is also applied to substances which originally but not ultimately fulfill
this condition. For example, it is applied to thermoset compositions or resinoids
in the final stages.</p>

<p><i>Plasticity.</i>—Susceptibility to and the retention of deformation. Capacity of
taking and retaining the form of a mold. The property of solids by virtue of
which they hold their shape permanently under the action of small shearing
stresses but are readily deformed, worked, or molded under larger stresses.</p>

<p><i>Polymerization.</i>—A chemical change resulting in the formation of a new
compound whose molecular weight is a multiple of that of the original substances.
The products of the reaction are called polymers. To distinguish from
those resulting from condensation (q. v.), they are often designated addition
polymers, since the reaction is that of successive addition of a large number of
relatively small molecules (monomers) to form the final polymer.</p>

<p><i>Power factor.</i>—In an insulating material, the ratio of total power loss (watts)
in the material to the product of voltage and current in a capacitor in which
that material is a dielectric.</p>

<p><i>Preforms.</i>—Molding powders converted by pressure and without heat into a
denser coherent form which approximates the shape of the final hot-pressed
article. Molding material converted to preforms has about half the bulk
factor of the original powder. Other forms of densified composition which do
not necessarily approximate the shape of the final molding are tablets,
briquettes, pellets, pills, and balls.</p>

<p><i>Resin.</i>—A term generally referring to a physical condition at room temperature
approximating the physical properties of natural resins. However, the
temperature of reference should not be limited to room temperature and the
term is here intended to embrace all substances which within a certain temperature
range show these, properties. For example, many oil-modified alkyd
resins are viscous liquids at room temperature but not at lower temperatures;
polystyrene is a resin at room temperature but rubberlike when warmed.</p>

<p><i>Resinoids.</i>—The class name applied to thermosetting resins. Temporary
thermoplastics. The name is also often applied to the final cured resins.</p>

<p><i>Softening point.</i>—Resins have no sharp melting point. Application of heat
causes gradual change from a brittle or exceedingly thick and slow flowing
material to a softer and less viscous liquid. The softening point is the
temperature at which the material flows at a definite rate or to a definite
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p><i>Synthetic resin.</i>—A complex, substantially amorphous, organic semisolid or
solid material (usually a mixture of substances) built up by chemical reaction
of comparatively simple compounds and, depending upon the temperature
at which the examination is made, approximating the natural resins in various
physical properties: namely, luster, fracture, comparative brittleness, insolubility
in water, fusibility or plasticity when heated or exposed to heat and
pressure, and, at a certain more or less narrow temperature range before fusion,
showing a degree of rubberlike extensibility; but commonly deviating widely
from natural resins in chemical constitution and behavior with reagents.</p>

<p><i>Synthetic rubber.</i>—Caoutchouc synthesized in the laboratory. The term is a
misnomer and most probably represents an impossibility.</p>

<p><i>Tensile strength.</i>—The greatest internal force per unit of cross section which
a material develops before failure under tension.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><i>Thermoplastic.</i>—The property of softening under heat. All molding materials
are thermoplastic at the initial application of heat. One class (the so-called
thermoplastics) remains soft permanently under heat; the other (thermosetting),
after first softening, sets or cures more or less quickly to a more
solid form. A practical distinction is that with the first class the mold must
be cooled before the molded article is removed, but not with the second. A
thermoplastic substance is adequately rigid at normal temperatures and under
ordinary conditions of stress but is capable of deformation under heat and
pressure.</p>

<p><i>Thermosetting.</i>—The property of undergoing a chemical change when heated
whereby a hardened product is obtained. Property most pronounced in phenol
and urea formaldehyde resins and less so with alkyds. A thermosetting substance
possesses initially the properties of a thermoplastic but under the influence
of heat undergoes chemical change so that it is no longer thermoplastic
but becomes permanently infusible.</p>

<p><i>Viscosity.</i>—Internal friction or resistance to change of form of a liquid.
The constant ratio of shearing stress to rate of shear.</p>

<p><i>Water-absorption.</i>—Amount of water taken up when exposed to humid conditions
or when immersed. Both rate of absorption and total absorption are
important, also change in dimensions. A certain amount of absorbed water may
improve mechanical properties but usually weakens electrical characteristics.</p>
